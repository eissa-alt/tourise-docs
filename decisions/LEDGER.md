# Decision Ledger

Append-only record of **durable, cross-task locked decisions** for alt-static-basecode. Numbered
`D1…Dn`, never renumbered. A task-local choice lives in that task's `TASK.md`; a decision that
outlives the task gets promoted here. This is the source of truth when a decision and the code/docs disagree.

## D1 — 2026-06-21 — cloned from pif-directors-gathering baseline

`alt-static-basecode` was cloned from the `pif-directors-gathering` upgrade-then-clone baseline
(source SHAs: backend `8745150` · admin `0f65026` · frontend `5e3fee2` · landing `55fd6b7` · docs `3cbca75`).
Inherited stack: **Next 15 / React 18.3.1 / Headless UI v2 / Tailwind v4 / Laravel 12** (Sentry removed,
OWASP-hardened). The frozen lineage record under `../upgrades/` documents what this baseline already includes.

- **What the baseline already includes:** [../upgrades/UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md](../upgrades/UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md)
- **Why directors was the chosen baseline:** [../upgrades/BASELINE_DECISION.md](../upgrades/BASELINE_DECISION.md)

## D2 — 2026-07-05 — dropped the `-landing` app

The directors baseline carried a 4th sub-app, `alt-static-basecode-landing` (Next 15 marketing site).
It is **not needed for this project** and has been dropped — `alt-static-basecode` is now a **three
sub-app** baseline (`-backend`, `-admin`, `-frontend`) plus `docs/`. Current-state docs were updated to
match; the frozen lineage under `../upgrades/` (and D1's clone-source SHAs) still mention `-landing` as
an accurate record of the baseline it came from.

## D3 — 2026-07-06 — unified admin forgot-password onto the invite reset-by-token flow

Admin "forgot password" now reuses the **same token machinery as the admin invite** instead of the
legacy `v2/password/forgot` guest endpoint. `AuthController::forgotPassword()` issues a one-per-email
`AdminInvite` token, emails the shared `emails.admin_invite.{en,ar}` blade (different subject only) via
a public `POST /admin/forgot-password`; the admin `forgot-password-form` posts `{ email, back_link }`
there, landing the admin on the same `reset-password/[token]` page as invites. This brings alt to
**cyan parity** on the reset flow, with **one deliberate deviation**: the endpoint is **enumeration-safe**
— it always returns success and only sends mail if the admin exists (cyan validates `exists:admins,email`,
which leaks account existence). The new route is **admin-only and additive**, so the mobile contract is
unaffected. Backend `a8184ca` / admin `70e646c` (both merged via PR #1). Detail: `HANDOFF.md`.

## D4 — 2026-07-06 — backend adopts the `dev` → PR → `main` workflow

The backend repo historically committed straight to `main` (it had no `dev` branch, diverging from
admin/frontend). It now uses **`dev`** as its working branch and merges to `main` via PR, matching the
other two app repos and CLAUDE.md's "work on `dev`, never push to `main`" rule. This resolves the
"backend branch convention" open item from the prior handoff. (`docs/` remains `main`-only — it is a
docs-only sibling repo with no app build/branch flow.)

## D5 — 2026-07-06 — lucide-react is the single icon library (dropped @iconify/react + @heroicons/react)

Both Next apps carried **two** icon libraries from the baseline (`@iconify/react` and
`@heroicons/react`). They are now unified on **`lucide-react`** and both old deps have been removed
from `package.json` + `yarn.lock`. The migration ran in two phases against a machine-verified
heroicon/iconify → lucide name map (P1: iconify removal incl. the `bi:tiktok` inline-SVG replacement;
P2: heroicons → lucide). All icon swaps are 1-for-1 (`className` sizing preserved), so this is a
zero-behaviour-change refactor — no icon is used by the mobile contract (admin/frontend only). Gates
green on both apps (`type-check` + `production`). Admin `de87b4b` (P2) / frontend `c74b82c` (P2),
stacked on the P1 lucide commits. Detail: `HANDOFF.md`.

## D6 — 2026-07-06 — real booleans over string pseudo-booleans; `status` → `is_active`

The baseline stored many flags as strings: `yes`/`null` and `yes`/`no` toggles (`is_saudi`,
`with_share`, `prefilldata`, …) and 2-value `status` (`active`/`blocked`) columns. These are being
converted to **real booleans**. Two tracks: **(A)** the `yes`/`no`/`null` + `with_`/`is_` flags —
this mirrors the **cyan** reference, which already did and documented it
(`115-cyan-basecode/.../docs_old/BOOLEAN_REFACTOR_*.md`); **(B)** a **new** conversion cyan never
attempted — strictly 2-value `status` columns become **`is_active boolean default(true)`**.
Multi-value process statuses (`app_notifications` Pending, `login_attempts` failed,
`email_attachments`, `sms_templates` send-state, guest workflow `guest_status_id`, mobile guest
`accepted`/`invited`) are **excluded**. Migrations are edited **in place** + `migrate:fresh` (no prod
data). The `/api/mobile/*` contract is unaffected (storage/internal only; mobile already sends
booleans and its speaker/sponsor resources don't expose `status`). Plan +
detail: [../upgrades/cleanup-hardening/BOOLEAN_REFACTOR_PLAN.md](../upgrades/cleanup-hardening/BOOLEAN_REFACTOR_PLAN.md) /
[../tasks/001-boolean-db-cleanup/TASK.md](../tasks/001-boolean-db-cleanup/TASK.md).

## D7 — 2026-07-07 — real date/time column types + cyan masked date input (no more Unix-string dates)

Dates/times were stored as **Unix-epoch strings** (day-picker fields: `getUnixTime()` +
`zonedTimeToUtc(…)/1000`) mixed with `Y-m-d H:i:s` datetime strings (`Carbon::now()` fields) in the
**same** `string` columns. Converted to proper types: date-only → **`date`** (cast `date:Y-m-d`,
API/forms `YYYY-MM-DD`), datetime → **`timestamp`** (cast `datetime`, ISO 8601 UTC), time-only kept
as **`string(5)` `HH:mm`** (matches cyan `meeting_room_slots`). Columns edited **in place** +
`migrate:fresh` (no prod data; same playbook as D6). FE/admin drop the react-day-picker modal for
cyan's **Cleave masked inputs** (`masked-date/-time/-datetime-input.tsx` + shared `utils/date.ts`
`formatDate`/`formatDateTime`); TZ conversion happens **at display** (`Asia/Riyadh`) so users outside
KSA are handled correctly. **`custom-day-input.tsx` is kept** (unused, for future custom cases) and —
revising the original plan — **`timezoneFix.ts` is kept too** because it is that component's only
remaining dependency (matches cyan). Mobile contract unaffected: guest dates live only in **Admin**
resources; the offline QR `check_in_time` write round-trips through the new `datetime` cast and
`routes/api.php` is unchanged. Gates green: backend `pint --dirty --test` + `migrate:fresh` +
`php artisan test`; both Next apps `type-check` + `production`. Detail:
[../tasks/002-datetime-db-cleanup/TASK.md](../tasks/002-datetime-db-cleanup/TASK.md).

## D8 — 2026-07-07 — agenda `date` is venue-local wall-clock (mobile contract change)

Follow-on to D7. Session/Workshop `date` (a `dateTime` column, cast `datetime`) was serialized with
`->toISOString()` (UTC `…Z`) while being **entered** via a native `datetime-local` (naive wall-clock,
no TZ). Because the API emitted UTC, the admin edit form's `data.date.slice(0,16)` pre-filled the
input with the **UTC** clock (`11:30` for a `14:30` Riyadh event), so opening a session/workshop and
saving **silently shifted the time −3h** (the Riyadh offset). **Decision (mirrors cyan, which never
UTC-converts these): treat agenda `date` as venue-local (Asia/Riyadh) wall-clock end-to-end.** All 9
resources (`AdminSessionsResources`, `AdminWorkshopResource`, Mobile `SessionList/Detail`,
`FavoriteSession`, `WorkshopList/Detail`, `RegisteredWorkshop`, nested in `SpeakerResource`) now emit
`->format('Y-m-d\TH:i:s')` (naive, **no `Z`**). No FE code change needed: the admin `.slice(0,16)`
pre-fill and `format(new Date(date))` display both become correct for every viewer (a `Z`-less string
parses as local, and format renders in local — the shift cancels). The `datetime` cast + naive
`datetime-local` submit already round-trip through the app's `Asia/Riyadh` timezone. **Mobile contract
change (flagged in `docs/mobile/BACKEND_INCOMING_CHANGES_FOR_MOBILE.html` §24):** mobile must parse
`date` as wall-clock and NOT convert to the device timezone. Audit timestamps
(`created_at`/`updated_at`, `check_in_time`, etc.) stay UTC ISO 8601 — only the scheduled agenda
`date` is venue-local. Gates: backend `pint --dirty --test` passed; isolated `SessionsTest` /
`WorkshopFeedbackTest` green (the one combined-filter search failure is a pre-existing test-isolation
flake, passes in isolation and cannot be affected by a serialization-format change). Detail:
[../tasks/002-datetime-db-cleanup/TASK.md](../tasks/002-datetime-db-cleanup/TASK.md).

## D9 — 2026-07-07 — caught errors are typed `unknown`, read via the `getApiError` helper

Closes the "cheap cleanups" phase. Every `catch (error: any)` in both Next apps (94 blocks across 82
files) was changed to `catch (error: unknown)`. Bodies that read the axios error now go through a new
shared helper **`utils/api-error.ts`** — `getApiError(error: unknown): ApiErrorResponse | undefined`
(returns `error.response` when `isAxiosError`, else `undefined`) — so `error?.response?.data?.*` reads
become `getApiError(error)?.data?.*` with real types instead of `any`. Log-only bodies
(`console.error(error)` / `throw error`) are simply re-annotated to `unknown`. This satisfies
CLAUDE.md's "no widening to `any`" rule and gives one canonical place to evolve the API-error shape.
**Going forward, new code must use `catch (error: unknown)` + `getApiError`, never `catch (e: any)`.**
`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` stays **off** globally (unchanged) — this was a targeted burn-down,
not a rule flip. Commits: admin `5ceacc3`, frontend `8544c39` (both on `dev`, unpushed pending review).
Gates green: `type-check` + lint 0 warnings, both apps.

## D10 — 2026-07-08 — backend gate is `pint --test` (repo is Pint-clean); backend tooling chain adopted

The backend was **not** Pint-clean at baseline, so the gate had been the workaround `pint --dirty`
(format only changed files; a repo-wide run churned ~170+ unrelated files). Task 003 (backend tooling
chain) closes that: an explicit **`pint.json`** (laravel preset + `no_unused_imports` + `ordered_imports`)
plus **one repo-wide Pint baseline** (commit `96413df`, 172 files, formatting-only) made the repo
Pint-clean. **Decision: the backend format gate is now the full `pint --test` (`composer lint`), not
`pint --dirty`.** Alongside it the chain added: **Larastan** static analysis at **level 0** (`bb61db9`)
with a generated baseline (124 real structural errors) and a **committed ratchet** (shrink to zero →
bump the level toward 6; runs in `composer analyse`/`qa`, never in the hook); **composer QA scripts**
(`lint`/`lint:fix`/`analyse`/`test`/`qa`); a **PHP-native pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`,
`9741e90`) that runs Pint on staged `*.php` and graceful-skips if Pint is absent (parity with the
admin/FE husky+lint-staged hook); and `.vscode/` **un-ignored + committed** with `[php]`→Pint
(`de75eed`) — fixing an inconsistency where admin/FE tracked `.vscode/` but the backend gitignored it.
Rector + CI were considered and left out (Rector = optional one-off in the cleanup plan; no repo has CI).
**Going forward the backend quality gate is `composer qa` = `pint --test` + `phpstan analyse` +
`php artisan test`.** Detail: [../tasks/003-backend-tooling-chain/TASK.md](../tasks/003-backend-tooling-chain/TASK.md).

## D12 — 2026-07-12 — admin bearer token is HttpOnly via a Next BFF proxy (Saudi P2 backport)

The admin stored its Sanctum bearer in a **JS-readable** `token` cookie (read by `cookie.get('token')`
across ~136 client sites), so any XSS in the admin could exfiltrate it → full account takeover. The
Phase-1 fix (`af2298b`, `secure`+`sameSite:'lax'`) hardened transport/CSRF but **could not** close the
XSS-read vector — `httpOnly` can only be set server-side. **Decision: adopt Saudi Forum 11's Point 2 —
the token lives ONLY in an HttpOnly cookie set by a Next.js BFF proxy; the browser never handles it.**
Un-defers Task 004 from Track B of `CLEANUP_AND_HARDENING_MASTER_PLAN.md` (user, 2026-07-12) — done now
because the basecode is **pre-launch with no clone carrying prod data**, so the large 135-file codemod is
cheap to bake into every future clone. What landed: `utils/{auth-cookies.ts,server/proxy.ts}` +
`pages/api/{proxy/[...path],auth/{login,login-confirmation,logout}}.ts`; isomorphic `utils/axios.ts`
(browser→`/api/proxy`, SSR→direct Laravel); `auth/provider.tsx`+`withAuth.tsx`+login/verify forms moved
onto a JS-readable **flag cookie** (`alt_admin_auth`) + an `authenticated` marker; a codemod removing all
dead `cookie.get('token')` reads (136) and `Authorization: Bearer` headers (261); and a **full CSP** in
`next.config.js` adapted to alt (env-derived origins, reCAPTCHA only — **no iconify** per D5, no Maps/Fonts,
`blob:` for print-js, `'unsafe-eval'` dev-only). Cookie is `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure(prod);
Max-Age=6h`. **Not mobile-facing** — admin-web only, `routes/api.php` untouched, mobile keeps its own
`MobileAuthController` flow. Gates green (`type-check` + `production`); BFF behavior verified at runtime
(login strips token + sets HttpOnly cookie, proxy injects Bearer from the cookie, logout clears both, OTP
+ streaming + CSP header all confirmed). **Real-env browser QA (live backend login, reCAPTCHA, heavy
export through the proxy) is still outstanding before `dev`→`main`** — Saudi hotfix-reverted their P2 once
over the streaming/CSP edges. Detail: [../tasks/005-admin-httponly-token/TASK.md](../tasks/005-admin-httponly-token/TASK.md)
(folder `005`; implements the plan's "Task 004 / Track B").

## D13 — 2026-07-12 — fix TitleSeeder null → `migrate:fresh --seed` restored

`php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` was **broken on `dev`**: 6 `TitleSeeder` rows passed
`show_in_user_form => null`, but that column is a NOT NULL `boolean default(false)` (D6 boolean refactor)
and is cast to boolean on the model — so the insert threw `SQLSTATE[23000] Column 'show_in_user_form'
cannot be null` and seeding died at Title (Country/Admin/GuestStatus/Category ran first). This was the
pre-existing bug the dropped migration-squash recon surfaced (see `tasks/004-migration-squash/TASK.md`
closing note); tasks 001/002 gates had run `migrate:fresh` **without** `--seed`, so it went unnoticed.
**Decision: fix the seeder, not the schema** — `null` meant "not shown", which for a NOT-NULL boolean is
`false`; the column + cast are correct as designed. Changed the 6 `null` → `false`. Verified: full
`migrate:fresh --seed` clean, all 8 seed-path seeders green, 12 titles seed (6 shown / 6 hidden / 0 null),
Pint + Title tests pass. Backend `dev` `a6fe3d1`. Not mobile-facing (seed data only). No other seeder in
the run path had the same null-into-bool pattern.

## D14 — 2026-07-12 — sensitive registrant files are private + served via signed URLs (Saudi P1 backport)

Registrant PII files — `guests.personal_image` (photos) and `guests.document_copy` (passport/ID copies)
— were written to Laravel's **`public` disk** and handed out as **raw, unauthenticated, CDN-cacheable
URLs** (`PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL/personal_image/…`), so anyone with or guessing a URL could fetch someone's
passport. **Decision: adopt Saudi Forum 11's Point 1 — sensitive files live on a `private` disk
(`storage/app/private`, never web-served) and are delivered only through short-lived signed URLs.**
Un-defers the plan's Task 005 / Track B (user, 2026-07-12); done now because the basecode is pre-launch
with no clone carrying prod data (squash/migration of live files would otherwise complicate it). What
landed: `private` disk in `filesystems.php`; new `GuestDocumentController` (`signedUrl()` +
signature-validated `stream()` with a `basename()` traversal guard, type allow-list, `Cache-Control:
no-store`); a `signed`-middleware route `GET /api/files/guest-doc/{type}/{file}` (`guest.doc.stream`);
uploads (incl. the **mobile self-service avatar** in `MobileAuthController`) repointed to `private`;
admin resource URLs → signed (30-min TTL) and **mobile `avatar` → signed (24-h TTL)**; 16 server-side
read-backs (badges/PDF/social-card/email-photo across 7 files) repointed from
`base_path('public/storage/…')` to `Storage::disk('private')->path(…)`; an idempotent
`guests:migrate-docs-to-private --dry-run` command (no-op on fresh clones, kept for clones with data +
a CDN-purge reminder); 2 stale phpstan-baseline `env()` ignores removed. **Dual TTL by decision:** admin
30 min vs mobile 24 h so app caches survive a session. **MOBILE CONTRACT CHANGE** — `avatar` is now a
signed, expiring URL (same field/type, bounded lifetime); mobile must re-fetch after expiry, not build
the URL itself → flagged in `docs/mobile/MOBILE_NOTICE_PRIVATE_AVATAR_SIGNED_URL.md`; **hold `dev`→`main`
until mobile acks.** Public assets (sponsor/speaker/badge/media/publication/attachment images) stay
public by design. Gates: `composer qa` green (`pint --test` + phpstan **No errors** + tests **452/3
pre-existing** — the 2 avatar failures confirmed to fail on the clean parent too, so no regression);
`migrate:fresh --seed` clean; runtime verified (private file streams 200 via valid signature, 403 on
tamper/no-sig, 404 on traversal, 404 at the old public path). Detail:
[../tasks/006-private-document-storage/TASK.md](../tasks/006-private-document-storage/TASK.md).

## D15 — 2026-07-13 — fix two Tailwind v4 regressions (error focus-ring + rtl:space-x-reverse)

Backport of Saudi Forum 11's `docs/upgrades/FIX_TAILWIND_V4_REGRESSIONS.md` — two v4-upgrade regressions
that alt's own v3→v4 pass missed (alt did the *normal* focus-ring restore, ledger D-era `TAILWIND_V4_CLEANUP_PLAN`,
but not these). Both className-only, no logic change. **Fix 1 — error focus-ring → `/50`:** v4 dropped
`ring-opacity-*`/`--tw-ring-opacity`, so a bare `focus:ring-red-500` / `focus-within:ring-error` on
error-state inputs rendered at full opacity (harsh solid ring) vs the soft `/50` normal ring. Carried the
opacity on the color class (`…/50`) — admin 11 files (commit `5d99b43`), frontend 5 files (`052f16f`).
Decorative rings that already had `/50` (e.g. the PIF step-2 Trash2 button) intentionally left alone.
**Fix 2 — drop `rtl:space-x-reverse`:** v4 rewrote `space-x-*` to logical properties
(`margin-inline-start/end`) that already flip under `dir="rtl"`, so `rtl:space-x-reverse` now *double*-flips
— RTL horizontal spacing landed on the wrong side. Deleted it everywhere (nothing replaces it) — admin 124
occ / 69 files (`aadadf8`), frontend 25 occ / 9 files (`721d458`). **Method note:** the removal is a
className-only token delete; an early scripted attempt corrupted indentation via a global whitespace
collapse and was fully reverted before redoing it surgically (token + one adjacent space only). Gates:
`type-check` + `production` green on both apps. Not backend/mobile-facing. **Visual EN/AR QA still pending**
(soft red ring on invalid inputs; RTL spacing on checkboxes/radios/back+share buttons/toolbars) — the one
thing automation can't confirm.

## D16 — 2026-07-13 — consolidate storage-URL env vars to a single source of truth

Collapsed the redundant/inconsistent storage-URL env vars across all three apps onto **framework-native
hosts**. Plan + full detail: [../upgrades/STORAGE_URL_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md](../upgrades/STORAGE_URL_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md).
Pre-launch (no prod data / CDN cache / shipped mobile), so the aggressive path — drop vars, change values,
no byte-identical-URL guarantee needed — was fine; the emitted URLs came out identical anyway.

**End state:** backend keeps **zero** `PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL*` vars (public URLs via
`Storage::disk('public')->url()` → `config/filesystems` → `APP_URL.'/storage'`); admin keeps **one**
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL` = storage **root**) + `utils/storage.ts` deriving `/uploads`, `/attachments`,
`/{module}` paths; frontend keeps **zero** (its var was comment-only dead). Sensitive registrant files stay
on the private disk + signed `*_url` (D14) — never rebuilt from an env var.

**Landed (on `dev`, unpushed):** FE `89c1ce3`; admin `b5bb5b2`→`9137fd9`→`fd628cd` (+ tracked `.env.example`);
backend `58ca08c` (new public `social_card_image_url`) + `5cebb86` (46 `env('PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL2')` sites /
28 files, incl. 7 mobile resources, → `Storage::disk('public')->url()`; self-healing sites →
`rtrim(...url(''),'/')`; phpstan baseline pruned 45→18 env ignores, masking nothing). Byte-identical output
verified via tinker (bare + leading-slash) → **mobile contract unchanged, no ack needed.**

**Fixed en route:** the `social_card` see-more URL had a wrong path (`/social_card` vs `/uploads/social_card`)
— now correct from the API. `visa_copy`/`issued_visa` confirmed **dead** (no column; upload allow-lists
`document_copy` only) so no URL added. **Deliberately deferred (separate correctness item, not env-var work):**
guest `custom-file-input{,-3}.tsx` still rebuild a public `/storage/uploads/{field}/` URL for files that now
live on the **private** disk (the `/upload` endpoints return `data` only) — likely a broken preview; fix by
returning a signed `url` from those endpoints. Tracked in the plan's follow-up.

**Gates:** FE + admin `type-check` + `production` green; backend `composer qa` green (`pint --test` + phpstan
**No errors** + tests **452 pass / 3 fail** — the same pre-existing ExampleTest-403 + 2 avatar failures,
confirmed identical on the stashed parent → no regression) + `migrate:fresh --seed` clean. **User owns the
gitignored `.env` edits** (drop the retired vars; retarget `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL` to the root).

> **Addendum 2026-07-17 — three corrections to the above. All pushed now (the "unpushed" note is stale).**
>
> 1. **The refactor missed the Blade email templates.** `5cebb86` swept `app/` only, so **22
>    `env('PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL2')` refs across 8 email views survived** (`otp/{en,ar}`,
>    `notify_guest/{en,ar}`, `password_reset/{en,ar}`, `partials/{header,footer}-poster`). When the var was
>    then dropped from `.env` (`4dfdca9`), `env()` returned null and **every email poster URL rendered as
>    `nullemails-config/…` — broken banners in all outgoing mail**. Repointed to
>    `\Storage::disk('public')->url()` in **`a9a1ed4`**; byte-identical, views compile (`view:cache`).
>    Lesson: sweep `resources/` as well as `app/` when retiring an env var.
> 2. **"Zero refs" only became true later.** `c1606a5` removed the last dead commented
>    `PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL` handlers from `GuestsExportView`. Verified zero across
>    `app/ config/ routes/ resources/ database/`.
> 3. **"`visa_copy`/`issued_visa` confirmed dead" is superseded by D18** — they were never dead, just
>    unfinished. They now have columns and full persistence.

## D17 — 2026-07-17 — one tracked env template per app: `.env.example_prod`

Unified how env templates are named, tracked and shaped across all three apps, so a clone gets a complete,
accurate template for free instead of hand-carrying files.

**Convention:** each app tracks **`.env.example_prod`** — a production-shaped template holding only
**live** vars, placeholder values, **no secrets**. `.env` / `.env.local` / `.env.production` stay gitignored
and are carried/created per environment (DevOps creates `.env.production` on deploy; its absence is why
`yarn production` can't run locally — expected, not a fault).

- **Backend:** `.env.example2` → **`.env.example_prod`** (`c7dd2ee`), retired `PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL*` +
  `APP_DEBUG=false` (`4dfdca9`). `.env.example` stays the Laravel-stock file. **Audited all 60 vars against
  Laravel 12.62: nothing unsupported.** Note the app deliberately runs on the **old** var names
  (`CACHE_DRIVER`, `BROADCAST_DRIVER`) because `config/` still reads those — do **not** "modernise" to L12's
  `CACHE_STORE`/`BROADCAST_CONNECTION` without changing `config/` too, or they'll be silently ignored.
- **Admin:** `.env.example` → **`.env.example_prod`** (`a5e83e6`), `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV` moved to the top
  (`e79e537`), structure unified with `.env.local` (`6f5ecdc`, `0dcf74a`). Down to the 6 live vars.
- **Frontend:** had **no** tracked template at all — added one (`27bad95`, `a22bd5b`) documenting the 5 live
  vars.
- **Cookie-age vars → code constants** (frontend parity with admin `a361586`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANG_COOKIES_AGE`
  (`7248f39`), `NEXT_PUBLIC_{,REMEMBER_}TOKEN_COOKIES_AGE` (`b5df5d3`, doc comment `220e65e`). Identical in
  every environment, so they're `LANG_COOKIE_AGE_DAYS=30` / `TOKEN_COOKIE_AGE_DAYS=1` /
  `REMEMBER_TOKEN_COOKIE_AGE_DAYS=7` in code now, not env.
- **`CLONE_CHECKLIST` corrected** (docs `2b118d5`): it claimed the prod template was gitignored and must be
  carried by hand — it's tracked (placeholders only), so only `.env` itself is carried.

**Known gap (accepted):** frontend `_app`/`_document` read `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM`, but the old env files set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER` — a name mismatch, so **GTM has been dormant, never firing**. The template
now documents the correct name; wiring it up (or removing the GTM blocks) is a separate task.

## D18 — 2026-07-17 — guest document + day fields are first-class in the basecode

Three guest fields had UI but no working data layer. Completed all of them rather than leave half-built
features that fail silently or 500.

- **`visa_copy` / `issued_visa` (`00fe02a` → `4883f9d`):** the public join form has `visa_copy`; the **admin
  guest create/edit forms have both** as real uploads. But `/upload-document` allow-listed only
  `document_copy` (→ **422 "failed to verify path name"**), and there was **no column, no `$fillable`, no
  save** — an uploaded visa hit the private disk and was then **silently dropped**. Widened both allow-lists
  + `GuestDocumentController::TYPES`, added the columns (mirroring `document_copy`), wired `store()` /
  `storeGuest()` / `updateGuest()`, and emit signed `*_url` (private disk, D14).
- **`days` (`ef218f6`):** was a **phantom** — `$fillable` + an index() `JSON_CONTAINS(days,…)` filter + an
  export column + a dashboard breakdown, but **no clone except `98-pif-2026` ever added the column**.
  `GET /admin/guests?days=X` returned **500** (`Unknown column 'days'`). `DashboardStats`/`GuestsExportView`
  were already guarded (`Schema::hasColumn` / ternary) — which is what revealed the field was *intentionally
  opt-in per clone*. **Decision: ship the column in the basecode** (`json` nullable, mirroring pif-2026's
  migration) so every clone gets it. **Still has no writer** — all 3 write sites stay commented and no UI
  submits it, so it reads NULL until a clone wires them up.
- **`json_decode(null)` guards (`ef218f6`):** `days` **and** `interests` were unguarded → a PHP 8.2
  deprecation on *every* guest response. The migration alone does **not** fix this — the deprecation fires on
  the null **value**, not the missing column, and both fields are nullable. Guarded with the ternary already
  used in `GuestsExportView:92`; output unchanged.
- **Factories repaired (`9042919`):** `Guest::factory()` threw `Unknown column 'status'` — it still set the
  free-text `status` column retired in the guest-status refactor (now the `guest_status_id` FK). Nothing
  caught it because the feedback tests use `Guest::create()` directly. Also wired
  `category_id => Category::factory()` (**new `CategoryFactory`**) since `category_id` is NOT NULL and always
  was — so the factory could never stand alone despite three sibling factories declaring
  `'guest_id' => Guest::factory()`.

**Gates (all):** `pint` + phpstan **No errors** + `migrate:fresh --seed` clean + tests **452 pass / 3 fail**
(same pre-existing ExampleTest-403 + 2 avatar). **Not mobile-facing** — `routes/api.php` untouched.

## D19 — 2026-07-18 — guest-drafts: capture abandoned registrations (own RBAC feature)

The admin carried a `guest-drafts` UI across clones but its **backend was never built** (no clone had it —
verified against pif-directors-gathering, gfeai-v2, etc.), so all three screens 404'd. Ported the complete
backend from **deve-go `60fe949`** (`draft-guests` branch) and finished the UI. Task + file-by-file port:
[../tasks/008-guest-drafts-port/TASK.md](../tasks/008-guest-drafts-port/TASK.md).

**What it is:** a registrant who fills step 1 and requests an OTP but never completes is upserted into a new
`guest_drafts` table (keyed by email); the draft is **deleted on successful registration**. So the table is,
by definition, everyone who started and didn't finish — a follow-up/lead-recovery list plus drop-off
diagnostics (OTP sent/verified/attempts, email vs phone). New: migration, `GuestDraft`, `GuestDraftResource`,
`GuestDraftsController` (index/show/export), `GuestDraftsExport`. Capture hooks are **additive** in
`AuthController` (`saveGuestDraft()` in email/phone `Verification`; mark-verified in the `Confirmation`s) +
`GuestsController::store()` (delete on complete). `guest_drafts` is a **self-contained new table** — it does
not touch the `guests` schema, so blast radius on existing behaviour is nil.

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Build, not remove.** Real purpose + a complete, safe-to-port reference. (The earlier "guest-drafts is a
   dead stub" note in the storage plan §4a is superseded.)
2. **Dedicated `guest_drafts` RBAC permission** (`view`/`export`/`see_more`) in
   `app/Support/AdminPermissions.php`, **enforced on the 3 routes via `admin.can`** — so this PII (people who
   never finished) is grantable independently of `guests_listing`. Note this is *stricter* than
   `guests_listing`, whose routes have no `admin.can` gating (frontend-only) — a deliberate deviation.
3. **`personal_image` served as a signed URL** (private disk, D14), not deve-go's public rebuild.
4. **Capture more than the reference did.** deve-go dropped several step-1 fields. Here the frontend OTP
   payload (`VerifyEmailForm.formData`) also sends **gender/title_id/personal_image**, and the backend
   additionally captures **`category`** (frontend sends the slug → resolved to `category_id`) and
   **`invitation_token`**. Employee-ID + Days rows were removed from the see-more modal (never populated).

**Known limitation:** the pif **four-step** form has no invitation-token prop, so its drafts don't capture
`invitation_token` (one-step forms do). Separate wiring if needed.

**Landed (pushed):** backend `7a96707`, admin `270a60d`, frontend `a8a94ec`. Admin listing already used the
modern `ListingFilters` stack, so deve-go's separate `search-guest-drafts.tsx` was **not** ported.

**Gates:** pint + phpstan **No errors** + `migrate:fresh --seed` clean + tests **452/3** pre-existing; admin +
frontend `type-check` + build green. In-browser QA confirmed capture (incl. signed photo, category via slug,
invitation token) and delete-on-completion. **Not mobile-facing.**

## D20 — 2026-07-19 — dropped the dead `days` guest column (supersedes D18's ship-it call)

D18 shipped `guests.days` on the theory a clone would wire the writer. A re-audit this session confirmed
it stayed a **phantom**: no writer anywhere (the registration store and every `Guest::create`/`update`
omit it; the 3 write sites remained commented), with read-only consumers only — the admin
`JSON_CONTAINS(days,…)` filter, the dashboard "by days" stats, the export column, and the admin resource
— all against an always-NULL column. Cross-checked the sibling clone **`122-gfeai-v2`**: same dead column
there too, populated only by a demo seeder and **superseded by a new `forum_days` field**, so `days`
carries no live meaning in the lineage. **Decision: remove it fully** — column + `$fillable` + filter +
stats + export cell/heading + resource field + the commented writes — lockstep across all three repos,
including the orphaned `days` / `days_want_to_attend` / `day1-3` translations (EN+AR). **Kept:** the live
`guest_drafts.days`, the `event_days` module, and the frontend countdown `days` label (a timer string,
unrelated). Backend `4899cfd`, admin `c4f86c5`, frontend `e2da469`. Gates: pint + phpstan **No errors** +
`migrate:fresh --seed` clean + tests **457/3** pre-existing; admin + frontend `type-check` green.

## D21 — 2026-07-19 — GTM: keep in frontend (correctly wired), never in admin

Closes the D17 "GTM dormant" gap. **Admin: no GTM at all** — verified zero component code and no GTM env
var in either `.env.example_prod` or `.env.local`; nothing to remove. **Frontend: keep it** — `pages/_app`
+ `_document` read `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM` (via `@next/third-parties/google`), and that variable now ships in
**both** the tracked `.env.example_prod` and the local `.env.local`, **empty by default (disabled)** so a
clone just drops in its `GTM-XXXX`. The old `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER` name mismatch that made it
dormant is already gone. No code/env changes were required — this entry records the decision and the
verified state.

## D22 — 2026-07-19 — Task 007: API response unification onto the standard envelope

Every API controller now returns the standard envelope from the 006 `ApiResponse` trait
(`{ success, status, message, data, meta? }` / `{ success:false, status:'failed', message, data, errors? }`),
via `BaseApiController::apiSuccess`/`apiError`. Rolled out in tiers: **admin (Tier A/B)** landed earlier this
session; **mobile (Tier C)** completes it — all `mobile/*` controllers migrated (`MobileAuth`, `MobileEventDay`,
`MobileSpeaker`, `MobileSponsor`, `MobileAttendee`, `MobileSession`(+`Feedback`), `MobileWorkshop`(+`Feedback`),
`MobilePublication`, `MobileMediaCenter`, `MobileQr`, `MobileRoom`, `MobileNotification`, `MobileChat`).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Mobile break is accepted + documented.** Payloads that were flat/scalar/root-level now live under `data`.
   The per-endpoint delta is [../mobile/RESPONSE_SHAPE_DELTAS.md](../mobile/RESPONSE_SHAPE_DELTAS.md) (flipped to
   **IMPLEMENTED**), the "adapt later" artifact required by the Task 007 formula.
2. **`AppConfigController` left unwrapped** (`/app-config`, `/app-config/version`) — config documents the Flutter
   client deserializes wholesale, wrapping adds churn with no unification value. Flagged in delta §18.
3. **`status` keeps legacy values** (`"success"`/`"failed"` or the endpoint's existing custom value) so any
   superset reader survives; `success`+`message` are additive on every response.
4. **`routes/api.php` unchanged** — body refactor only, so the route contract (also the mobile contract) is intact.
5. Two listing-only controllers (`GuestEmailLogsController`, `InvitationEmailLogsController`) keep extending
   `Controller` to avoid a `private applyFilters()` collision with `BaseApiController`; they carry the full
   envelope via `->additional([...])` instead.

**Gates:** pint + phpstan **No errors**; tests **457/3** (the 3 are pre-existing D14 signed-avatar/env failures,
not from this work). Backend feature tests updated in lockstep with each controller. **Remaining:** mobile-team
ack of the deltas, then backend `dev` → `main`.

## D23 — 2026-07-19 — gate scanning is a first-party admin feature (standalone "agent admin" retired; new `scanning` RBAC feature)

On-site gate scanning was an **out-of-repo standalone web client** (the "agent admin"), reached via a
separate `loginAgent` and dual-prefix (`/admin/*` **and** no-`/admin`) scan endpoints that Task 010 had
frozen. `108-tasama` and `112-pif-partners-forum-demo` had already pulled the scanner **into** their admin
CMS keyed off an `admins.type='gate'` column — but ALT dropped `type` in favour of RBAC, so it was the
deliberate outlier with no in-admin scanner. **Decision: port scanning into the ALT admin as a first-party,
RBAC-gated feature and retire the standalone client + its shims.** Task + phase-by-phase detail:
[../tasks/011-scan-into-admin/TASK.md](../tasks/011-scan-into-admin/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **New `scanning` RBAC feature** (`['view']`) in `app/Support/AdminPermissions.php`, **distinct from
   `gates`/`areas`/`scans`.** `gates`/`areas`/`scans` = *manage/report* gates in the CMS; `scanning` =
   *operate* a gate (the live scan UI). A "gate agent" is just a role granting `scanning` (usually nothing
   else) — **no `type` column, no separate login**. They log in normally and the dashboard shows the scanner
   because `checkFeaturePermission('scanning', user)` is true.
2. **Data scope is enforced server-side** (closes the 108/112 gap where any token scanned any gate).
   `GatesController::deniesGateScope()` gates `showAgentSide`/`setup`/`start`/`pause`/`scan`: the target gate
   must match `admin.gate_id` (once bound by `setup`) and/or fall inside `admin.area_id`; **super-admin
   short-circuits**.
3. **Endpoints modernized + un-frozen** into a `/admin/gate-scan` group behind `admin.can:scanning`
   (`gates`, `gates/{id}`, `gates/{id}/setup|start|pause|scan`, `search-guests`, `scans/{id}/image`,
   `scans/{id}/guest`). The retained offline-sync endpoints (`attend`, `guest-data-offline`,
   `guest-data-sync`, `guests-printed-since`) moved behind the same feature. **Dropped:**
   `AuthController@loginAgent` + route, the four no-`/admin` scan aliases, and the dangling
   `validate-check-in/{regNumber}` route (handler gone since Task 010, no callers). This **lifts Task 010's
   RENAME_MAP §F freeze.**
4. **Camera lib swapped, dep count flat.** 108/112's `react-web-qr-reader` (unmaintained, React 16/17) →
   **`html5-qrcode`** (maintained, framework-agnostic, dynamic-imported so it never runs server-side); also
   dropped `react-lottie` (their scan-pulse dep) for a CSS pulse — net new deps ≈ 0.
5. **Recovery flow completed.** 108/112 only uploaded a badge photo for an unrecognised QR; ALT's
   `wrong-qr-recovery-modal` also **searches by name and links the guest to the orphan scan**
   (`search-guests` → `scans/{id}/guest`).
6. **Not mobile-facing.** The scanner is the web iPad client, not the Flutter app; the retired/renamed URIs
   were confirmed absent from the mobile contract, so `routes/api.php`'s mobile surface is intact.

**Deferred (still open):** the recommended `scans.gate_id` FK — the port ships on the existing `gate_name`
string link (`Gate::scopeWithUniqueCount`); and **live browser-QA + the RBAC/scope manual matrix** (needs a
running stack + camera), validated so far only by feature tests + type-check/build.

**Landed (on `dev`):** backend `211e17d` (scanning feature + endpoints + `GateScanTest`) → `cd66c21`
(`admins/select` filters by `scanning`); admin `1c87ff0` (gate-scan UI port + nav + `/scans` icon +
`type=gate` cleanup + EN/AR). **Gates:** backend `composer qa` green (pint + phpstan + tests incl.
`GateScanTest`); admin `yarn type-check` + `next build` green (`yarn production` needs the gitignored
`.env.production`).

## D24 — 2026-07-20 — `routes/api.php` brought to the cyan RESTful standard (grouped + `admin.can:` gated + `whereUuid` + `toggle-status`)

The legacy admin surface of `routes/api.php` was 966 lines of mostly-flat, ungated, non-RESTful routes
(vs cyan's 559-line grouped/gated/RESTful shape). Task 010 rewrote it as a **hard cutover** — no
alias/back-compat window; backend + admin + frontend callers moved together. Task + rename map:
[../tasks/010-api-routes-cleanup/TASK.md](../tasks/010-api-routes-cleanup/TASK.md) +
[../tasks/010-api-routes-cleanup/RENAME_MAP.md](../tasks/010-api-routes-cleanup/RENAME_MAP.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Every admin resource folded into a `Route::prefix('admin/<res>')->group()` block**, static routes
   before `/{id}` wildcards, `->whereUuid('id')` on every UUID param.
2. **RESTful rename is a hard cutover** — `/x-select` → `/x/select`, `/guests-new` → `POST /guests`,
   `/guests-update/{id}` → `PUT /guests/{id}`, `/invitations-list/{id}` → `/invitations/{id}/list`, etc.
   Category updates went `POST` → `PATCH`. Admin API client + frontend public `countries/select` +
   `titles/select/{cat}` repointed in lockstep.
3. **`block/{id}` + `activate/{id}` replaced by a single `PATCH /{id}/toggle-status`** outright (no legacy
   pair kept); `toggleStatus()` added to the 14 controllers that only had `block`/`activate`.
4. **`admin.can:<feature>` gating on every admin group**, cross-checked against `AdminPermissions::CATALOG`
   (Super-Admin short-circuits, deny-by-default); per-action perms on writes; dashboard gated per-widget.
   **Left ungated on purpose:** all `-select`/`select-all` + `categories/slug` (feed cross-module dropdowns
   / guest forms — gating them would 403 an admin working in a *different* feature).
5. **Dead code removed:** dead comments, duplicate registrations, 7 orphaned `GuestsController` methods,
   the dead `guests-status-*` block, and 5 zero-caller ops/queue endpoints (+ `OperationActionsController`,
   `QueueController`).
6. **`mobile/*` is untouched** — the mobile contract (also `routes/api.php`) is intact; no `mobile/*` URI
   changed, so no `RESPONSE_SHAPE_DELTAS` row was needed. (The scanner/agent surface was frozen by Task 010
   then un-frozen + modernized by Task 011 / D23.)
7. **Final close-out (2026-07-20):** the last two non-RESTful, ungated, zero-caller leftovers —
   `POST /admin/guests-upload-zip` + `POST /admin/match-guests-images` (bulk guest-image upload/match) —
   were folded into the guests group as `POST /admin/guests/upload-zip` + `POST /admin/guests/match-images`
   behind `admin.can:guests_listing,edit`. The four offline-sync endpoints (`attend`, `guest-data-offline`,
   `guest-data-sync`, `guests-printed-since`) were **left at their URIs** — a deliberate Task 011 decision
   (D23), kept behind `admin.can:scanning`.

**Landed (on `dev`):** backend `4cf7036` (Tier 0+1 dead-code/endpoint cleanup) → `c5a3a31` (Tier 2 RESTful
cutover + prefix groups + `whereUuid` + `toggle-status`) → `9328d65` (Tier 4 `admin.can` gating) → `68723ee`
(dead ops/queue removal); admin `e36b384` (API client repoint + `toggle-status`); frontend `53d42e0`
(public `countries/select` + `titles/select`). **Route count 418 → 384.** **Gates:** backend `composer qa`
green (pint + phpstan **No errors** + tests **465/3** — the 3 are the pre-existing `ExampleTest` `/`→403 +
two avatar signed-URL fails, not from this work); admin + frontend `yarn type-check` green. **Remaining:**
manual smoke test per renamed/gated feature (needs a running stack + role matrix).

## D25 — 2026-07-20 — LinkedIn **automatic** "Share on LinkedIn" completed for the per-category social share

ALT already shipped the **manual** half of the category social-share feature (`with_share`,
`share_poster{,_ar}`, `share_type` = `manual|automatic`, `share_text_{en,ar}`, blade social card, admin form
section, bulk-update modal), but the **`automatic`** path the admin form advertised was never wired. Task 012
completed it, ported **best-of-both** from cyan (P37.4) + hci and adapted to ALT conventions. Task:
[../tasks/012-linkedin-auto-post/TASK.md](../tasks/012-linkedin-auto-post/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Scope = Tier A only** (LinkedIn auto-post). ALT keeps its **blade** social card; cyan's Social Card
   **Layout Designer** / JSON document-rendering engine (Tier B) was explicitly **out of scope**.
2. **Per-category LinkedIn app credentials** — two nullable columns `linkedin_client_id` /
   `linkedin_client_secret` on `categories` (additive migration `2026_07_20_000001`), only consulted when
   `share_type = automatic`; unset → the OAuth endpoints 422. Creds round-trip through `update()`
   `$request->only()` + `CategoriesResources` (the gap cyan had). Not added to `bulkUpdateSocialMedia` — an
   app id/secret is inherently per-category, set individually in the form.
3. **LinkedIn API surface stays on v2** (`/v2/ugcPosts`, `/v2/assets?action=registerUpload`, `/v2/userinfo`,
   header `X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0`) — the current documented surface for the **consumer**
   "Share on LinkedIn" product (`w_member_social`). The `/rest/*` Posts API needs a Marketing product and
   would 403 here; **do not "modernise" to `/rest/*`.**
4. **The three OAuth routes are public** (guest-facing, no admin/guest auth), in the public/localization
   group: `GET /linkedin/auth-url`, `GET /linkedin/call-back`, `POST /linkedin/post`. `getVisibility()` now
   also returns `share_type` so the public success page knows manual vs automatic.
5. **Frontend URL read via `config('app.frontend_url')`, not `env()`** — new config key mirroring
   `PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL`, added so `LinkedInController` satisfies larastan `noEnvCallsOutsideOfConfig`
   (the pervasive legacy `env('PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL')` calls elsewhere stay baselined; new code uses config).
6. **Frontend kept ALT-native** — the ported share component uses lucide `Share2`, `getApiError`, and
   `react-hot-toast` (not cyan's iconify / `ThreeDotsWave`). New `pages/[lang]/linkedin-redirect.tsx` OAuth
   landing page; `share_type` + `category_slug` thread `success.tsx` → `success-sections.tsx` →
   `sharebtn-sections.tsx`.
7. **`mobile/*` untouched** — new routes are public web only; no mobile contract delta.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev` — backend `c9884ca`, admin `c2885c2`, frontend `e8d7991`):** backend — migration + `LinkedInController` + `Category` fillable +
`CategoriesController` (`getVisibility`+`update`) + `CategoriesResources` + `config/app.php` + `routes/api.php`;
admin — `categories-form.tsx` + `interfaces/category.tsx` + EN/AR `web.json`; frontend — `linkedin-redirect.tsx`
+ `success/sharebtn-sections.tsx` + `success/success-sections.tsx` + `join/[category]/success.tsx`. **Gates:**
backend `composer qa` green (pint + phpstan **No errors** + tests **465/3** pre-existing); admin + frontend
`yarn type-check` + eslint green. **Remaining:** manual QA with a real LinkedIn Share app + running stack.

## D26 — 2026-07-20 — SMS provider config moved from `.env` to a DB-driven admin CRUD (cyan "SMS SMTP" port)

SMS transport credentials were pinned to `.env` via `config('services.unifonic')` and read directly in
`SendGuestSMSListener`. Task 013 ported cyan's **SMS provider config** stack so SMS credentials are now
DB-managed by admins (multi-row, `is_active` + a single `is_default`) exactly like the existing
`smtp_configs` mail stack — the foundation for the follow-up SMS tasks. Task:
[../tasks/013-sms-provider-config/TASK.md](../tasks/013-sms-provider-config/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Mirror `smtp_configs`, not cyan verbatim** — ALT already runs the DB-driven SMTP pattern, so the SMS
   stack reuses its exact shape: multi-row, `is_active` + single `is_default`, secret masked on the wire
   (`app_sid_masked`, last 4), leave-blank-to-keep on edit, `BaseApiController` + `apiSuccess/apiError`,
   `admin.can:` gating, admin BFF-proxy calls, lucide + `getApiError` + `react-hot-toast` (no
   `js-cookie`/Bearer, no heroicons). Additive migration `2026_07_20_000002_create_sms_provider_configs_table`.
2. **Provider abstraction via `App\Services\Sms\SmsSender` + `provider_key`** — v1 validates `unifonic`
   only (`Rule::in(['unifonic'])`); a new provider = one enum append + a `sendVia*` branch + (optionally)
   surfacing the generic `api_key`/`api_secret` slots in the form. Unknown `provider_key` throws
   (`InvalidArgumentException`) so a stale row fails loud instead of silently no-op'ing. `SmsSender` returns
   the raw HTTP `Response` (Unifonic returns 200 even on failure — the `success` JSON key is the real signal).
3. **Secrets encrypted at rest** — `app_sid`/`api_key`/`api_secret` use the `encrypted` cast; the resource
   returns only `app_sid_masked`, and `api_key`/`api_secret` never leave the backend (`$hidden`).
4. **`send-test` + the listener honour the non-production guard** — on non-prod both return/record
   `sent:false` + a reason instead of hitting the provider, so dev/stage never sends real SMS.
5. **RBAC `sms_config` widened** `['view','update']` → `['view','create','update','delete','block']` to
   cover the new CRUD + toggle-active (block), matching `smtp_configs`. Routes live under a gated
   `admin/sms-provider-configs` group (admin-only).
6. **Clean cutover, no dual path** — the `config/services.php` `unifonic` block was **removed** (a fresh env
   setting `UNIFONIC_*` would silently do nothing), and the dead `GuestsController` debug methods
   `sendSMS2`/`sendSMS3`/`smsReplacePlaceholders`/`buildQrCodeLink`/`buildInvitationLink` (+ their commented
   `web.php` routes + the now-stale `env()` phpstan-baseline entry, `count: 2`) were pruned — they duplicated
   the real listener path and only referenced the old env creds.
7. **SMS templates left as-is (out of scope)** — ALT already has an unlinked `sms/templates` + `sms/config`
   admin page set; only the provider-config layer was missing. The follow-up "new SMS tasks" the user flagged
   will surface those. **`mobile/*` untouched** — new routes are admin-only.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev` — backend `96a15ce`, admin `661f134`):** backend — migration + `SmsProviderConfig` + `SmsProviderConfigResource`
+ `SmsProviderConfigController` + `Services/Sms/SmsSender` + `SendGuestSMSListener` (rewired) +
`AdminPermissions` + `config/services.php` (unifonic removed) + `GuestsController` + `routes/{api,web}.php` +
`phpstan-baseline.neon`; admin — `interfaces/sms-provider-config.ts` + `admin-modules/sms/provider-configs/*`
(form + listing + delete/send-test modals) + `pages/[lang]/sms/provider-configs/{index,create,edit/[id]}` +
`data/sidebar-links.tsx` + `data/module-icons.tsx` + EN/AR `web.json`. **Gates:** backend `composer qa` green
(pint **passed** + phpstan **No errors** + tests **465/3** pre-existing); admin `yarn type-check` + eslint
clean + `next build` compiles (new `/sms/provider-configs*` routes present). **Remaining:** manual send-test /
delivery QA in production with a real Unifonic app.

## D27 — 2026-07-20 — Per-flow SMTP override (choose which SMTP account sends each email flow)

Emails always used the single active-default `smtp_configs` row via `DynamicSmtpService::applyDefaultIfAvailable()`.
Task 015 lets admins pick a different SMTP account per flow, falling back to the default when blank/inactive.
Task: [../tasks/015-per-flow-smtp-override/TASK.md](../tasks/015-per-flow-smtp-override/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **One shared resolver** — `DynamicSmtpService::applyConfigById(?id)` applies an active override, else the
   active default (or `.env`). Inactive/deleted overrides never hard-fail a send.
2. **Category SMTP is two pickers** — `categories.smtp_config_id` covers notification emails
   (register-complete / accept / reject). Guest email-OTP uses a separate
   `categories.otp_smtp_config_id` (join form posts the `category` slug). Both blank → active default.
   Admin CMS login OTP is out of scope.
3. **Snapshot at create** — the resolved override is copied onto `guest_emails` / `automations` /
   `invitation_emails` so later category/setup edits don't change what a queued/sent row used. Guest
   email-OTP has no send-row → resolves live from the category slug.
4. **Automations: DB override beats `MAIL_HOST_BULK`** — the static `smtp-bulk` mailer is only used when no
   override is present.
5. **Invitations resolve invitation → collection → default** — nullable `smtp_config_id` on both
   `invitations` and `invitation_collections`.
6. **Admin pickers** list active configs only via ungated `GET admin/smtp-configs/select` (blank = use
   default). Additive migration `2026_07_20_000003_add_smtp_config_override_columns`.
7. **`mobile/*` untouched** — only an admin select route was added; public/OTP request/response shapes
   unchanged.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev` — backend `2adc387`, admin `76ae079`):** backend — migration + `applyConfigById` + snapshot wiring in
`GuestsController` / `InvitationEmail::createFromInvitation` / automation expansion + notification
`toMail()` paths + `AuthController` guest OTP + validation/resources + `smtp-configs/select`; admin —
`smtp-config-select` + pickers on category / automation / invitation / invitation-collection forms + EN/AR.
**Gates:** pint + phpstan clean; admin `yarn type-check` green. **Remaining:** manual QA with multiple SMTP
accounts.

## D28 — 2026-07-20 — Guest OTP SMS de-hardcoded onto the dynamic provider + per-flow SMS provider override (SMS mirror of D27)

Guest **phone-OTP** was sent by a hardcoded FGC gateway (`https://cnc.fgc.sa/authenticate` + `sendSmsNotifications`)
with a **plaintext username/password committed in `AuthController`** (`sdbankApi` / `SDB` sender). Both private
methods (`authenticateSMSAPI`, `sendSMS`) and the `Http` import are **deleted** — no static SMS gateway code
remains. OTP now flows through the same DB-driven stack register-complete SMS uses (D26: `SmsProviderConfig` +
`SmsSender`). Same shape as D27 for email.
Task: [../tasks/014-otp-sms-dynamic-config/TASK.md](../tasks/014-otp-sms-dynamic-config/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **OTP relies only on the dynamic provider** — `SmsSender` currently speaks Unifonic only, so OTP is now
   delivered by whatever active provider resolves (category override → active-default). The FGC gateway is
   gone; if a client mandates a specific gateway, add it as a `provider_key` branch on `SmsSender` (not
   hardcoded in a controller).
2. **Category SMS is two pickers** (mirrors D27) — `categories.sms_config_id` = register-complete
   notification SMS; `categories.otp_sms_config_id` = phone-OTP SMS. Both nullable FK → `sms_provider_configs`,
   null-on-delete. Blank/inactive/deleted → active-default. OTP resolves live from the join-form `category`
   slug; register snapshots onto `guest_sms.sms_config_id` at create.
3. **OTP sends in every environment** — unlike `SendGuestSMSListener` (which blocks non-production bulk/
   notification SMS), phone-OTP calls `SmsSender` directly and sends on dev/stage too, because it's a code the
   registrant is actively waiting for (preserves prior behaviour). ⚠️ In non-prod this now hits the *real*
   active-default provider instead of the old FGC test gateway.
4. **Admin picker** lists active providers via new ungated `GET admin/sms-provider-configs/select`; reusable
   `sms-provider-config-select` component. Additive migration `2026_07_20_000005_add_sms_config_override_columns`.
5. **`mobile/*` untouched** — `phone-verification` request/response shapes unchanged; only an admin select
   route was added. Mobile login-OTP (separate path) not in scope.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev` — backend `ae2ad17`, admin `568e56a`):** backend — migration `000005` + `AuthController::phoneVerification`
rewritten (FGC methods deleted) + `SendGuestSMSListener` honours the snapshot + `GuestsController` register/
resend snapshot + `Category`/`GuestSMS` fillable + `CategoriesController` validation/persist +
`CategoriesResources` + `SmsProviderConfigController::selectList` + route. admin — `sms-provider-config-select`
+ two category pickers + `interfaces/category` + EN/AR. **Gates:** pint + phpstan clean; admin `yarn
type-check` + eslint green. **Remaining:** manual QA with a real active provider (dev now sends via the
active-default, not FGC).

## D29 — 2026-07-20 — SMS flow parity: accept/reject + automations + invitations now text (mirrors the email flows)

Before this, email fired on register-complete / accept / reject / automations / invitations, but SMS only
fired on register-complete + phone-OTP. Task 016 closes the three gaps so every guest email flow has an SMS
twin, each with its own optional provider override (extends D26/D28).
Task: [../tasks/016-sms-flow-parity/TASK.md](../tasks/016-sms-flow-parity/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Guest-backed flows reuse `guest_sms` + `SendGuestSMSEvent`** — accept / acceptToCategory / reject
   (Stage 1) and automations (Stage 3) already target a `Guest`, exactly like register-complete, so they
   create a `guest_sms` row (snapshotting `sms_config_id`) and dispatch the existing listener. **No new
   per-flow SMS table** for these. The listener's non-production block still applies (dev/stage won't send
   bulk/notification SMS).
2. **Invitations get their own `invitation_sms` table + listener** — invitations are token-based, not
   guest-backed, so they mirror `invitation_emails`: nullable `sms_template_id` + `sms_config_id` on both
   `invitations` and `invitation_collections`; `InvitationSms::createFromInvitation` resolves
   invitation → collection; `SendInvitationSmsEvent`/`SendInvitationSmsListener` render invitation-specific
   placeholders (`{{ first_name }}`, `{{ last_name }}`, `{{ invitation_link }}`) and send via `SmsSender`.
   Fired from invite / bulk / reminder alongside the email event; `extract-bulk` inherits the source
   collection's SMS template unless overridden.
3. **Automations add `with_sms_template`** (mirrors `with_email_template`) + `sms_template_id` +
   `sms_config_id` on `automation_setups`. SMS is **independent of email** — a setup may text, email, or
   both. `AutomationController::send` fires the guest_sms event per guest when the toggle is on; `split`
   carries the SMS fields to each chunk.
4. **Provider override, same rule as D28** — blank/inactive/deleted `sms_config_id` → active-default. The
   choice is snapshotted onto the send-row at create time.
5. **Out of scope:** OTP text stays inline (D28); `SmsSender` remains Unifonic-only; **`mobile/*`
   untouched** (only admin forms/routes changed).

**Landed (pushed, on `dev` — backend `7ba6152`, admin `79f1995`):** backend — migrations `000006` (invitation SMS) + `000007` (automation
SMS); `InvitationSms` model + `SendInvitationSmsEvent`/`SendInvitationSmsListener` (+ `EventServiceProvider`);
`InvitationsController` / `InvitationsCollectionController` persist + dispatch; `AutomationSetupsController`
store/split persist; `AutomationController::send` dispatches guest_sms; `AutomationSetup` /
`Invitation` / `InvitationCollection` fillable + casts; `Invitation`/`InvitationCollection`/`AutomationSetups`
resources expose the fields. admin — SMS template + provider pickers on invitation / collection / extract-bulk /
automation forms; `with_sms_template` toggle; `sms-template-select` `errors` prop made optional; interfaces +
EN/AR (`sms_override`, `with_sms_template`). **Gates:** backend `pint --test` **passed** + `phpstan` **No
errors**; admin `yarn type-check` + eslint green. **Remaining:** manual QA with a real active SMS provider.

## D30 — 2026-07-21 — Invitations send on a single delivery channel (email | sms), not both

**Reverses the parallel-send half of D29.** D29 wired an SMS twin *alongside* the invitation email, so a
collection could fire both at once. In practice that made status, error-tracking, and "resend" ambiguous
(resend *what* — the email, the SMS, or both?). An invitation collection now picks **exactly one** channel.
Task: [../tasks/017-single-channel-invitations/TASK.md](../tasks/017-single-channel-invitations/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**
1. **`channel` enum on `invitation_collections` + `invitations`** (`email` | `sms`; `whatsapp` reserved but
   rejected server-side), default `email`, folded into migration `2026_07_20_000006`. The store/update paths
   **scope the template + provider to the chosen channel** and null the other side, so only that channel can
   fire. `extractBulk` and the collection edit propagate `channel` down to child invitations (sends read the
   per-row snapshot).
2. **Admin picks the channel up-front** via a dropdown, and unconfigured channels are **disabled** (gated on
   a configured default SMTP / SMS provider) with a link to set them up — you can't choose a channel you
   can't send on. Overrides follow the category switch-before-dropdown pattern (toggle on → show picker).
3. **Status is channel-agnostic** — a successful SMS send bumps `invitation.is_sent` / `send_count` exactly
   like email, and the `invite` guard checks `phone` for SMS collections (not `email`). Resend re-sends the
   one channel the collection is on.
4. **Observability:** `InvitationResource` exposes `channel` + `sms_template_name`; the listing shows a
   channel badge and the see-more modal has an SMS-history tab twinning the email history.
5. **WhatsApp is deliberately deferred** — reserved in the picker as a disabled "coming soon" option; the
   next channel task, not this one.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** backend `0fcd3c5` (`InvitationsController` / `InvitationsCollectionController`
scope + propagate, channel-aware guard, SMS status bump; `Invitation`/`InvitationCollection` fillable +
`smsTemplate` relation; `Invitation`/`InvitationCollection` resources; migration `000006` channel column);
admin `f1589df` (channel picker + per-channel override sections on the create + collection-edit forms;
channel badge in listing; SMS-history tab; wider bulk-send modal with channel/phone/template columns;
reorganized update-info modal; `DialogShell` 4xl/5xl; `ui-select` disabled options; titles preloaded once;
interfaces + EN/AR). **Gates:** backend `pint --test` + `phpstan` **No errors**; admin `yarn type-check` +
eslint green. **Remaining:** manual QA with a real active provider.

## D31 — 2026-07-21 — Category communications restructured (master email/SMS gates + `with_email_otp` rename) + SMS log observability

Two related consolidations. Task:
[../tasks/018-sms-logs/TASK.md](../tasks/018-sms-logs/TASK.md) (logs) and the categories comms work folded
into 017's session.

**Durable decisions:**
1. **Master channel switches `with_email` / `with_sms`** on categories, enforced centrally in
   `Category::getNotificationTemplate` — when a master flag is off the backend returns no template for that
   channel, so it **never sends** on it regardless of per-event settings. Child per-event values are kept
   (turning the master off hides but doesn't destroy them).
2. **`with_otp` → `with_email_otp` rename** for symmetry with the pre-existing `with_sms_otp`. Value/meaning
   unchanged (category requires an email-OTP step). Cross-repo lockstep: backend resource + guest OTP guard,
   admin form, **and** the public frontend join pages (they read the flag off the category payload and pass
   it as `withOtp` — miss one and email OTP silently disables). **Mobile payload rename** — invitation-verify
   responses now return `with_email_otp`; documented in
   [../mobile/MOBILE_NOTICE_CATEGORY_WITH_EMAIL_OTP_RENAME.md](../mobile/MOBILE_NOTICE_CATEGORY_WITH_EMAIL_OTP_RENAME.md).
   Both flag changes folded into the categories migration (no new migration — `migrate:fresh` workflow).
3. **Admin-access scope on the categories form** — a new "Admin access" tab lists every admin (any
   role/status) so a fresh category can be dropped into their data scope at create/edit time, backed by a new
   `GET admin/categories/assignable-admins` endpoint.
4. **SMS logs** — read-only guest + invitation SMS log listings mirroring the email logs, behind a new
   `sms_logs` RBAC feature (`view` / `export`). `guest_sms` and `invitation_sms` each get a
   controller/resource/export + a super-gated admin page under `/logs`, beside the email logs in the sidebar.
   Note: SMS `is_sent` is a real boolean (email logs use `yes`/`no` strings), and SMS has no
   delivered/open/click, so those columns are intentionally dropped.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** backend `3c73f0f` (categories comms + `assignableAdmins` + `with_email_otp`
rename across resource/model/migration/seeder/export + guest OTP guard) + `34e09e7` (SMS log
controllers/resources/exports + `sms_logs` permission + routes); admin `702d9b1` (admin-access tab +
validation-error surfacing + form width/gating) + `8b0960f` (SMS log pages + sidebar) + `69ddd13`/`4c83678`/
`2cf9409`/`4c83678` (earlier P17 comms/status UI); frontend `0d0d82b` (join pages read `with_email_otp`).
**Gates:** backend `pint --test` + `phpstan` **No errors**; admin + frontend `yarn type-check` + eslint
green. **Remaining:** manual QA with live providers.

## D32 — 2026-07-22 — Logistics + e-visa re-added (Task 019): ops-confirmed data stays its own table; the February e-visa console is dead code

The P5.trim (backend `08d542e`, admin `e3a0677`, both 2026-06-24) removed hotels/rooms,
traveling-status, guest logistics and e-visa as "unused modules". Task 019 brings them back,
modernized to everything this repo adopted afterwards (Tasks 001/002/009/010, P17.4).
Task: [../tasks/019-logistics-evisa-port/TASK.md](../tasks/019-logistics-evisa-port/TASK.md).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **`guest_logistics` remains a separate 1:1 table — do NOT fold it into `guests`.** The two hold
   different data, not duplicates. `guests` carries what the registrant DECLARED on the join form
   (`expected_date_of_arrival`, `flight_arrival_time`, `require_flights`, `check_in_date`);
   `guest_logistics` carries what operations BOOKED (`arrival_date`, `arrival_time`,
   `check_in_date`). Both tables legitimately have `check_in_date`. Collapsing them destroys the
   "guest asked for the 5th, we booked the 6th" comparison. The admin UI labels the ops side
   `admin_*` for this reason — those ~24 EN/AR keys survived the trim and were reused.

2. **The February e-visa "operations console" is NOT ported, and should not be.** It lives only on
   the unmerged `origin/evisa` (backend `95d426d`) + `origin/Imtnan` (admin `a10fd14`).
   `merge-base(evisa, e-visa) = a379b35` and `evisa` is not an ancestor of `e-visa` — they are
   parallel attempts, and hci merged the March one. hci `main` has no trace of the console and its
   last e-visa commits are 2026-03-03. It also **conflicts**: it drives `e_visa_status` with
   `pending`/`in_process`/`received` while the shipped lifecycle uses `in_progress`/`issued` — two
   state machines on one column, `in_process` vs `in_progress` being a silent trap. Its
   `deriveGuestState()` additionally reads columns that do not exist here and treats
   `empty($guest->valid_visa)` as "no visa", which with a real boolean makes `null` (never asked)
   read as eligible.

3. **E-visa eligibility is `valid_visa === false`, strictly.** `valid_visa` is a nullable boolean
   here (Task 001 Track A), not hci's `'yes'`/`'no'` string: false = declared no visa/iqama =
   eligible; true = already holds one; **null = never asked** (only foreign nationals are). A
   `!== true` shortcut would make every Saudi/GCC registrant eligible. The e-visa listing endpoint is
   hard-scoped to `valid_visa = false` — do not widen it; those rows carry passport-grade PII.

4. **E-visa file I/O is entirely on the `private` disk** (Task 006). hci reads
   `base_path('public/storage/uploads/...')` and writes `storeAs('public/...')`. Here reads go via
   `addFromDisk('private', …)`, writes via `Storage::disk('private')->putFileAs()` into
   `GuestDocumentController::TYPES`, and the package zip saves to the private disk. The visa xlsx is
   piped into the zip with `Excel::raw()` rather than hci's temp file, so no PII spreadsheet is left
   on disk.

5. **Bulk guest queries stay on `GuestsController`.** `applyAdminGuestAccessFilter` (the P18.3
   category scoping) is private there, and hci's `EVisaController` carries a third copy of it.
   Not duplicated: `EVisaListing`, `ExportVisa` and the four logistics exports live on
   `GuestsController`; `EVisaController` and `GuestLogisticsController` hold only per-guest,
   id-keyed operations.

6. **`inferFeatureId` is first-match-wins, and nested pages MUST precede their parent.** Rooms live
   at `/hotels/[hotel_id]/...`, logistics at `/guests/[slug]/logistics/...`. Both needed their rule
   inserted ABOVE the broader `/hotels` and `/guests` rules, or the page gates on the wrong feature
   and renders for an admin whose API calls then 403. Callers pass `router.pathname`, so the literal
   `[hotel_id]` segment is matchable and exact. This is the bug class already shipped in `sms_logs`.

**Landed (pushed: NO — local on `dev`):** backend `303c629` (hotels/rooms/traveling-status +
guest_logistics schema, models, controllers, resources, routes, RBAC), `0ed06f3` (4 logistics
exports), `0ea04fb` (`valid_visa` persistence fix), `89f1673` (e-visa generation, PDF, issued-visa,
export, listing); admin `8641f65` (hotels/rooms/traveling-status CRUD), `01764ab` (per-guest
logistics screen + hotel assignment), `83ba223` (e-visa console); frontend `b0e7e49` (`valid_visa`
sent as a boolean).

**Gates:** backend `pint --test` + `phpstan` **No errors** + `migrate:fresh --seed` clean; admin
`yarn type-check` + `next build` **123/123 pages**; frontend `yarn type-check` + build clean; EN/AR at
parity (web 1611/1611). **Mobile contract unaffected** — every new route is `/admin/*`, nothing
removed or renamed, no `Mobile*` resource touched, so no mobile notice was issued.

**Remaining:** `sendIssuedVisa` is NOT ported — hci `main` emails the issued visa
(`workflow_value = 'ON_ISSUED_VISA'`, sets `e_visa_status = 'sended'`). `issued_visa_send_count` /
`issued_visa_sent_at` exist here with casts and the console renders a send-count column, but nothing
writes them; the columns are kept deliberately for when it is built. Missing prerequisites:
`categories.issued_visa_email`, `guests.issued_visa_sent`, `guests.issued_visa_sent_by`, and the
`ON_ISSUED_VISA` workflow value. Also open: the logistics screen's `Promise.all` fails hard for an
admin with `guest_logistics` but not `guests_listing,see_more`; and manual QA of the whole flow.

## D33 — 2026-07-22 — `inferFeatureId` is first-match-wins: six mismatches found, and the sweep that finds the seventh

Closing out Task 019 surfaced the same defect class six times, twice in code that had already
shipped. `utils/inferFeatureId.ts` maps a route to its RBAC feature by `Array.find` — **first match
wins** — and it is consumed by `TypeGate` (page access) and `TopSection` (action buttons), while the
sidebar carries its own hand-declared `featureId`. When the two disagree, nothing errors: the link
appears and the page refuses, or the page renders and the API 403s.

**Durable rules:**

1. **A nested route MUST be registered above its parent.** `/hotels/[hotel_id]/...`,
   `/guests/[slug]/logistics/...`, `/logs/(guest|invitation)-sms`, `/emails/smtp-configs` all sit
   under a broader rule that would otherwise swallow them.
2. **Callers pass `router.pathname`**, i.e. the Next route PATTERN with the parameter name intact
   (`/hotels/[hotel_id]/rooms/create`) — never a resolved id. Matching the literal `[hotel_id]` is
   therefore exact, and lets a rule cover a detail page without also matching sibling static routes
   like `/hotels/create`.
3. **Every new page needs a rule.** A missing rule resolves to `null`, and `TypeGate`/`TopSection`
   then fall back to Super-Admin only — which silently defeats a purpose-built feature (see
   `/gate-scan`, where the whole point of the `scanning` feature from D23 is a gate-agent role that
   is not a super admin).
4. **The sidebar's declared `featureId` and `inferFeatureIdFromPath(href)` must agree.** This is
   mechanically checkable and should be a test — a ~20-line script parsing both files caught the two
   pre-existing cases (`/emails/smtp-configs`, `/gate-scan`) that six rounds of human/agent review had
   missed. All 28 live sidebar links now agree.

**Instances:** rooms, guest logistics and e-visa (caught during Task 019, never shipped wrong);
`sms_logs` (shipped in P18.2 — `/logs/guest-sms` + `/logs/invitation-sms` gated on `email_logs`);
`/emails/smtp-configs` and `/gate-scan` (both long-standing).

**Also landed in this pass (P20):**
- admin `621abdb` sms_logs rules; `1bd50e5` smtp-configs + gate-scan rules
- admin `7193f6f` — the logistics screen called `/admin/guests/...` while the axios base already ends
  in `/api/admin`, so every request 404'd and the screen rendered its error state on every load. It
  shipped that way in P19.4. **Rule: admin Axios paths are relative to a base that already includes
  `/api/admin` — never prefix `/admin/`.**
- admin `436d225` — the logistics loader's `Promise.all` spans two features
  (`guest_logistics` + `guests_listing,see_more`); the guest leg is now tolerant, hides the
  guest-declared fields when unreadable, and drops them from the PUT so they cannot be nulled unseen.
- backend `ecce5a6` — `CategoriesExport::map()` omitted `visibility`, printing 20 values under 21
  headings; every column from position 6 was shifted one left.
- backend `c9bbdf9` — `phpunit.xml` had the sqlite/`:memory:` env commented out, so `php artisan test`
  ran `RefreshDatabase` against the real MySQL dev database. Two `EventDaysTest` assertions compared a
  raw `date` column (`2026-11-16` on MySQL vs `2026-11-16 00:00:00` on SQLite) and were rewritten to
  compare through the model cast. With the avatar fixtures and the stock `ExampleTest` also fixed,
  `composer qa` is green end to end (467/0) and the documented "465 pass / 3 pre-existing" baseline is
  retired.

## D34 — 2026-07-22 — E-Visa lifecycle closes: `sent` is the terminal state, and `check:rbac` guards the map

**Durable decisions:**

1. **The e-visa lifecycle is `null → in_progress → issued → sent`.** `sent` is written by
   `EVisaController::sendIssued` when the issued visa is emailed to the guest. hci `main` uses the
   typo'd `'sended'` for this state — alt does **not**; anything ported from hci that compares against
   `'sended'` is wrong here.
2. **`sendIssuedVisa` reuses the existing guest-email machinery**, it does not send mail directly: a
   `GuestEmail` row with `workflow_value = 'ON_ISSUED_VISA'` plus `SendGuestEmailEvent`, exactly like
   the other category-driven notifications. That inherits the D27 per-flow SMTP override for free.
3. **`categories.issued_visa_email` is the template selector**, nullable FK → `email_templates`,
   picked on the category form's actions tab, ungated (there is no `with_issued_visa` toggle). The
   send endpoint 422s with a message naming that exact path when it is unset.
4. **`guests.issued_visa_sent` from hci was deliberately NOT added.** `issued_visa_sent_at` is a
   nullable timestamp and already encodes "has it been sent"; a parallel `'yes'`/`'no'` string would be
   a second source of truth. `issued_visa_sent_by` (FK → admins) *was* added, for the audit trail.
5. **Re-sending is intentional.** Every send increments `issued_visa_send_count`; the confirm step
   tells the operator how many times the guest has already received it. Do not "fix" this into a
   one-shot.

**A process note worth keeping.** The two lanes that built this each did their job correctly and the
result was still unusable: the backend required `categories.issued_visa_email` and 422'd with "set it
in Categories → …", while nothing in the admin could set it, because that lane was scoped to the
e-visa console. Neither lane was wrong; the SEAM was. When splitting work, the thing to verify is not
each half but the path a user actually walks through both.

**Guard added:** `yarn check:rbac` (admin, zero-dependency) cross-checks every sidebar `featureId`
against `inferFeatureIdFromPath(href)` and against the backend catalog, exiting non-zero on
disagreement. Written because the D33 trap had produced six bugs and every one was mechanically
detectable. Consider running it beside `yarn type-check` in the gate.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** backend `6219994`; admin `1416537` (check:rbac) and its parent (send
action + category picker). **Gates:** `composer qa` green (pint + phpstan + 467/0);
`yarn type-check` + `next build` 123/123; EN/AR parity 1618/1618; `migrate:fresh --seed` clean with
both new columns.

**Remaining:** none of Task 019, P20 or P21 has been exercised in a browser. The e-visa **send**
action in particular has never been run — it emails a real guest via a real template.

## D35 — 2026-07-24 — Email/SMS audit hardening pass (P23): 33 fixes, and the two deliberately left

A full audit of the email/SMS subsystem (transport → send flows → single-channel invitations → category
gating → logs → admin/frontend) surfaced 45 candidates; **33 survived adversarial verification** and were
fixed across 14 reviewed commits (backend P23.1–P23.12, admin P23.13, frontend P23.14).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **SMS sends in every environment now** (`28eca40`). The `config('app.env') !== 'production'` block was
   removed from both SMS listeners and the provider test endpoint. Rationale: `SmsSender` only talks to the
   real Unifonic API — there is no `log`/fake transport like email's `MAIL_MAILER=log`, so the guard made
   local/stage SMS untestable. **Consequence:** any SMS trigger (incl. a bulk automation/invitation run)
   sends real texts with real cost from dev/stage — test with your own number. Phone-OTP already sent in all
   envs, so this only makes the other flows consistent.
2. **Email was left sending in every environment too — H2 NOT applied.** The audit flagged email's missing
   non-prod guard as high severity, but a guard was explicitly rejected: it breaks local email testing.
   Email delivery is controlled the normal Laravel way (`.env` `MAIL_MAILER` → `log`/mailpit); the only real
   exposure is a staging box pointed at prod data with an active `smtp_configs` row, which is an ops concern.
3. **Accept/reject notifications were silently dead and now work (H1, `d0cd0b0`).** `GuestsController::accept`
   and `reject` constrained-eager-loaded the category without `with_email`/`with_sms`, so the D31 master gate
   read them as `null` and returned no template on **every** accept/reject — killing that mail/SMS even when
   the admin had configured it. Register/accept-to-category load the full model and were unaffected.
4. **Phone OTP hardened (`0c8ee04`):** CSPRNG (`random_int`), a **30-minute TTL**
   (`config('auth.phone_otp_ttl_minutes')`, env `PHONE_OTP_TTL_MINUTES`) enforced at both `phoneConfirmation`
   and the registration gate, and persist-after-send (the token row is written only once the SMS goes out).
5. **Automation `send()` is idempotent (`14085a6`):** a setup already `started`/`splitted` returns **409**
   instead of re-blasting; only not-yet-sent rows are processed. Also: the status-change / category-move /
   poster side-effects now run on the **email** path (previously only the no-email branch), and `split()`
   carries `with_e_badge` (chunked automations no longer drop the e-badge).
6. **Category OTP flags require their master channel (`e8da311`, L-nocrossvalidation).** `store()`/`update()`
   reject `with_email_otp` without `with_email` (and the SMS pair), matching the documented master-switch
   semantics (D31). Validation-only — never touches data at rest.
7. **`env('PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL')` → `config('app.frontend_url')`** in the guest SMS listener and the email
   variable resolver (`d1ae700`, `eaa76be`) — `env()` returns null under `config:cache`, yielding host-less
   links in a queued worker. Two stale `phpstan-baseline.neon` env entries were pruned in the same breath.

**The two deliberately deferred (with a precondition, not just "later"):**

- **L-otpgate — gate the OTP *send* on the master `with_email`/`with_sms` flag.** The docs say master-off
  should block OTP too, but `with_email`/`with_sms` were added with `default(false)` and **no backfill
  migration**, and `migrate:fresh` is now banned (real data), so the live state is unknown. Gating the send
  before auditing risks 500ing registration for any category with `with_email=false` + `with_email_otp=true`.
  **Precondition:** run `SELECT id, name_en FROM categories WHERE (with_email_otp=1 AND with_email=0) OR
  (with_sms_otp=1 AND with_sms=0);` — 0 rows → safe to gate; any rows → fix that data first. D35.6's new
  validation stops fresh inconsistencies regardless.
- **L-reminderemail — SMS-only invitations have no reminder path** (`sendReminderByEmailsList` keys on the
  `email` column, which is null for SMS-only invites). This is a feature (phone-list endpoint + admin UI +
  mobile-contract check), not a fix — fold into the WhatsApp work.

**Landed (committed on `dev`, NOT pushed — awaiting review):** backend P23.1–P23.12
(`d0cd0b0`,`28eca40`,`5b934c1`,`0c8ee04`,`d1ae700`,`b1f07e8`,`d7bf834`,`42e6269`,`14085a6`,`eaa76be`,`7eb1e54`,`e8da311`);
admin `f17ed0a`; frontend `c69f35c`. **Gates:** every commit green — backend `pint --test` + `phpstan`
No-errors; admin/frontend `yarn type-check`. **`routes/api.php` untouched → no mobile-contract delta.**

**Remaining:** the L-otpgate data audit above; manual QA of the changed flows against a live provider —
especially the now-real test-SMS endpoint and the 30-min OTP TTL vs. the 4-step form's real completion time.

## D36 — 2026-07-24 — WhatsApp channel added end-to-end (invitations + guest/automation notifications + inbound RSVP + WhatsApp OTP), built as a twin of the email/SMS stack

A full WhatsApp delivery channel (Meta WhatsApp Cloud API) was added across the backend, admin and public
frontend, mirroring the existing email/SMS subsystems feature-for-feature. `x-hci-campaign` was assessed as a
possible base and used as a **reference only** for the Meta-specific mechanics (Graph payload, webhook signature,
template variable/button mapping) — every ALT-facing piece (provider config, templates, single-channel invitations,
observability tables, event/listener sends, category master-gate, admin listing/form layout, join-form OTP) was
built as a faithful twin of our own code, not ported. Plan:
[../upgrades/WHATSAPP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](../upgrades/WHATSAPP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **Everything twins email/SMS; x-hci is reference-only.** `WhatsAppProviderConfig` mirrors `SmsProviderConfig`
   (multi-row, `is_active` + single `is_default`, encrypted creds, secret masked on the wire, leave-blank-to-keep);
   `WhatsAppTemplate` is a Meta-pointer twin of `SmsTemplate`; sends go through queued events/listeners
   (`SendInvitationWhatsAppEvent` / `SendGuestWhatsAppEvent`) exactly like the SMS pair; observability is separate
   tables (`invitation_whatsapp` / `guest_whatsapps`, `createFromInvitation` snapshot) twinning `invitation_sms` /
   `guest_sms`; admin screens copy the `sms/provider-configs` + `sms/templates` layout. No `DynamicFormRenderer`,
   no new conventions.
2. **Transport is `App\Services\WhatsApp\WhatsAppSender`, keyed on `provider_key`** — v1 speaks `meta_cloud` only
   (`Rule::in(['meta_cloud'])`); a new provider = one enum append + a `sendVia*` branch. It builds the Meta Graph
   `type:template` payload (name + language + components: body params + URL/quick-reply button) and returns the raw
   HTTP `Response`. `WhatsAppTemplateRenderer` resolves a template row → send-args (invitation / guest / OTP), with
   per-language (`_en`/`_ar`) Meta template name, body-variable and button-URL-index mapping.
3. **Schema changes are additive forward-only migrations.** `migrate:fresh` is banned now that the DB holds real
   data, so four new `2026_07_24_*` migrations ADD the whatsapp tables/columns (`whatsapp_provider_configs`,
   `whatsapp_templates`, whatsapp FKs + `invitation_whatsapp` on invitations, `guest_whatsapps` + automation/category
   whatsapp columns) — no existing migration was edited.
4. **Invitations extend the single-channel model (D30) to a third channel.** `channel` is now
   `email | sms | whatsapp`; store / extract / collection-edit scope the template + provider to the chosen channel and
   null the others, so exactly one channel fires. Guest-backed flows (register / accept / reject / automations) gate on
   the category `with_whatsapp` master switch via `Category::getNotificationTemplate('...','whatsapp')`, mirroring the
   D31 email/SMS master gates.
5. **Inbound RSVP webhook.** `GET /webhooks/whatsapp` verifies `hub.verify_token` against the active-default
   provider's `verify_token` (`hash_equals`); `POST /webhooks/whatsapp` validates the Meta `X-Hub-Signature-256`
   HMAC with the provider `app_secret`, then per-entry: delivery **statuses** update the matching log row, and
   quick-reply **button** replies set `reply_status` (`confirmed` / `declined`) + `replied_at`. A `confirmed` reply
   fires a QR follow-up (a `purpose='qr'` active template) through the same send pipeline.
6. **WhatsApp OTP shares the SMS phone code — a delivery twin, not a second code.**
   `AuthController::whatsAppVerification` writes to the **same** `phone_verifications` table and is verified by the
   **same** `phoneConfirmation`; only the send endpoint differs (a `purpose='otp'` template + `otp_whatsapp_config_id`).
   The registration gate accepts either `with_sms_otp` or `with_whatsapp_otp`; `store()`/`update()` cross-validate
   `with_whatsapp_otp ⟹ with_whatsapp`. The public join form offers WhatsApp as an OTP channel, reusing the phone
   step / confirm / `sms_otp_token` verbatim.
7. **RBAC: two new features** — `whatsapp_config` + `whatsapp_templates` (CRUD, mirroring `sms_config` / sms
   templates) and `whatsapp_logs` (`view` / `export`), all under `admin.can:`-gated route groups.

**Landed (committed on `dev`, NOT pushed — awaiting review):**

- backend (12): `d33affa` (W0.1 provider CRUD), `f185608` (W0.2 template CRUD), `28ec5d8` (W0.3 `WhatsAppSender` +
  send-test), `d4daaf8` (W1a invitation pipeline), `51b0622` (W1b invitation controllers), `2ee06bf` (W1c invitation
  logs + `whatsapp_logs` RBAC), `555a91e` (W2a guest/automation pipeline + `with_whatsapp` gate), `114bc35` (W2b
  fan-out + register/accept/reject), `7a370b0` (W2c guest logs), `f7e8ea8` (W3 webhook), `14eff38` (W4 OTP), `c224dd3`
  (W4 expose `with_whatsapp_otp`).
- admin (5): `8d4f2f3` (W0.4 provider UI), `030df8b` (W0.5 template UI), `0f09641` (W1d invitation channel picker),
  `e536590` (W2 automation toggle + category gate + log pages), `f58872f` (RSVP badge alignment).
- frontend (1): `657c173` (W4 join-form WhatsApp OTP option).
- docs: `1d9ee7f` on `main` (`WHATSAPP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, committed earlier).

**Gates:** every commit green — backend `pint --test` + `phpstan` **No errors**; admin + frontend `yarn type-check`
(husky eslint/prettier). EN + AR landed in the same commits.

**Mobile contract:** additive only, but new **public** surface area — three new public routes
(`GET` + `POST /webhooks/whatsapp`, `POST /guests/whatsapp-verification`) and an additive `with_whatsapp_otp` field
on the invitation/category verify responses. Nothing was removed or renamed, so no existing mobile endpoint changed;
the webhook + verification routes are server-to-server / web and not consumed by the Flutter client. Confirm against
`docs/mobile/BACKEND_INCOMING_CHANGES_FOR_MOBILE.pdf` before wiring mobile to any of it.

**Remaining:** manual QA against a real Meta WABA — template approval, live template send, webhook signature + RSVP
round-trip (confirm → QR follow-up), and OTP delivery; nothing is exercised against Meta yet. Also: when a category
enables **both** `with_sms_otp` and `with_whatsapp_otp`, the join form has no channel picker and prefers WhatsApp —
add a picker (or a precedence decision) if both-on becomes a real configuration.

## D37 — 2026-07-25 — Automations move to a single delivery channel (email | sms | whatsapp), mirroring the invitations channel model; the create form reskinned to the Section-card pattern

An automation setup previously used the **multi-toggle** model — three independent booleans
(`with_email_template` / `with_sms_template` / `with_whatsapp_template`), any combination of which fired for the
same guest in one run. It now picks **exactly one** delivery channel, adopting the invitations single-channel
`channel` concept (D30 / D36) for a clean, trackable "this automation went via X" record. This is a deliberate
**behaviour reduction** — an automation can no longer notify across multiple channels at once — chosen over the
multi-channel-cards alternative after weighing it against tracking/consistency.

**Durable decisions:**

1. **`channel` is the single source of truth + the tracking field; the `with_*_template` booleans stay as
   send-path storage and are derived from it server-side.** `store()` sets exactly one boolean true from
   `channel` and nulls the two non-selected channels' template/config ids (e-badge is gated to email). This keeps
   the `AutomationController` fan-out and `split()` — which both read the booleans — **untouched**, so the actual
   send path did not change. `split()` also carries `channel` onto chunked setups.
2. **Schema is additive forward-only.** A new `2026_07_25_000001_add_channel_to_automation_setups` migration ADDs a
   nullable `channel` string; no existing migration was edited (`migrate:fresh` remains banned). Pre-existing rows
   keep their old booleans and get `channel = null` — harmless, since automation setups are one-shot and have
   already fired.
3. **Validation is channel-driven.** `channel` is `required|in:email,sms,whatsapp`; the template ids move from
   `required_if:with_*_template,yes` to `required_if:channel,<x>`. `AutomationSetupsResources` now exposes
   `channel` (and the previously-missing `with_whatsapp_template` / `whatsapp_template_id` / `whatsapp_config_id`,
   for parity with the email/SMS fields).
4. **The admin create form is reskinned to the invitations/categories Section-card pattern.** Three grey
   toggle-boxes → a single gated **Channel** dropdown (`check-default` disables a channel with no configured
   default + an amber "Configure X →" link), each channel revealing its template + a switch-before-dropdown
   provider override; a centered `lg:col-10` layout and a sticky Cancel / Submit footer. The ~10 previously
   hardcoded English strings (paste placeholders/help, cross-check buttons, totals, "Attachments", "Custom PDF
   attachment", the with-share hint) are routed through `translate()`, with EN + AR keys added in the same change.

**Files:** backend — `2026_07_25_000001_add_channel_to_automation_setups.php`, `AutomationSetup.php`,
`AutomationSetupsController.php` (`store` + `split`), `AutomationSetupsResources.php`; admin —
`automation/automation-form.tsx`, `translations/{en,ar}/web.json` (11 new keys).

**Mobile contract:** no change. Automation-setups is admin-only (`TypeGate super`), not in `routes/api.php`'s
mobile surface — no endpoint added, removed, or renamed.

**Gates:** backend `pint --test` **passed** + `phpstan` **No errors** + `php artisan test` **468 passed** (the one
failure, `SessionsTest > search finds matching sessions`, is a pre-existing order-dependent flake — it passes
30/30 in isolation and is unrelated to automations). Admin `yarn type-check` **green**; `eslint` clean on the form.
`yarn production` was not run (no local `.env.production`; env files are gitignored and not created). EN + AR keys
in place.

**Status:** landed in the working tree, **NOT committed** — awaiting review.

## D38 — 2026-07-25 — Automation create becomes a filter-and-select guest picker (replaces paste-emails): `guest_ids` list_type + `/guests/select-ids`, built on the shared listing primitives

Admins disliked the old automation workflow (go elsewhere → filter/export guests → copy their emails
or registration numbers → paste them into the automation form). The `/automation/create` page is now
an in-app **filter → pick → run** flow: the shared guest filter panel, a checkbox table, and a "Run
automation" popup that fires on the picked guests.

**Durable decisions:**

1. **Audience contract = selected guest IDs.** The automation store gains a third `list_type`,
   `guest_ids`, resolved via `Guest::whereIn('id', …)` — additive alongside the existing `emails` /
   `registration_numbers` paths. The picker ships the resolved IDs, so what is selected is exactly
   what runs (count locked at click time). Validation is `guest_ids => required_if:list_type,guest_ids|array`
   + `guest_ids.* => uuid` (no per-row `exists` — `whereIn` drops unknowns, and per-row `exists`
   would fire one query per ID on a large select-all).
2. **"Select all matching" resolves server-side.** `GET /admin/guests/select-ids` reuses `index()`'s
   `applyFilters` + `applyAdminGuestAccessFilter` and returns `{ ids, count }`, so selecting the whole
   filtered set is identical to what the listing shows and works across pagination. Admin-only
   (`admin.can:guests_listing`), not in the mobile contract. The `store` `guest_ids` path trusts the
   submitted IDs (no re-scoping) — fine while automation-create is super-only; re-scope if it ever
   opens to restricted admins.
3. **Create page replaced — no dual path.** `/automation/create` renders the picker; the paste form
   (`automation-form.tsx`) is **deleted**. Its Name/Channel/Actions block was extracted to a shared
   `automation-settings-fields.tsx` (react-hook-form `FormProvider`) consumed by the run-automation
   modal, keeping the single-channel model + gated overrides from D37.
4. **Built on the shared listing primitives**, not a hand-rolled table: `ListingTable` +
   `ListingFooter` + an e-visa-style selection bar (checkbox `select` column, "Total selected: N of
   M", select-all/clear/primary buttons). Documented as the reusable pattern in
   [../ai/LISTING_SELECT_PATTERN.md](../ai/LISTING_SELECT_PATTERN.md) — the canonical exemplar is the
   e-visa listing.

**Files:** backend — `AutomationSetupsController@store` (guest_ids branch), `GuestsController@selectIds`,
`routes/api.php`; admin — `automation/automation-guest-picker.tsx`, `automation-run-modal.tsx`,
`automation-settings-fields.tsx`, `pages/[lang]/automation/create.tsx`, deleted `automation-form.tsx`;
docs — `ai/LISTING_SELECT_PATTERN.md` (+ `ai/README.md` pointer).

**Gates:** backend `pint --test` + `phpstan` **No errors** + `php artisan test` **469 passed**; admin
`yarn type-check` + `eslint` clean. EN + AR keys in place.

**Also in this wave:** the delivery **channel became optional** — an automation may be actions-only
(status / poster / category with no message). The modal gates the channel behind a "Notify guests"
switch and `store` accepts `channel = null` (extends D37's single-channel model). UI polish: the
picker + listing + view-more render on `ListingTable` / `ListingFooter`; the listing name links to
details and its columns regroup into Notification / Actions; and the shared `SearchGuestsBySuper`
**Reset** now clears its inputs before navigating (**P24.24** — also fixes the `/guests` page).

**Landed (committed on `dev`, NOT pushed):** backend `49ece52` (P24.23); admin `17ad5cf` (P24.23 —
picker / modal / shared-fields, paste form removed, listing regroup) + `ffb01d3` (P24.24 — Reset fix).
Docs on `main` carry this entry + `ai/LISTING_SELECT_PATTERN.md`.

## D39 — 2026-07-25 — Automation scheduling: "Send immediately" (auto-dispatch on create) or "Schedule for later"; a shared `AutomationDispatchService` + a cron-driven command; **prod must run the Laravel scheduler**

The run-automation modal gains a **Scheduling** step: *Send immediately* (default) or *Schedule for
later* + a **clean masked date + time pair** (the shared `MaskedDateInput` / `MaskedTimeInput`, same
components as the logistics forms, combined into `scheduled_at` on submit — not the native
`datetime-local`). Adapted from `120-pif-private-events-platform`'s scheduling scaffold, but rewired to
**our** multi-channel fan-out (120's dispatcher is email-only/older-pattern — not copied).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **Send/dispatch is one shared loop.** The per-guest fan-out (which of `SendAutomationEmailEvent` /
   `SendGuestSMSEvent` / `SendGuestWhatsAppEvent` / `SocialCardGenerationEvent` to fire, plus the
   status/category/poster side-effects and per-row `is_sent` idempotency) lives in
   `App\Services\AutomationDispatchService::dispatch()`. It is called by all three entry points — the
   manual "Send" button (`AutomationController@send`), the immediate-on-create path
   (`AutomationSetupsController@store`), and the scheduled command — so every path behaves identically.
   The service **fires the existing events**; it does not replace the event→queued-listener
   architecture (sending still flows event → listener → supervisor `queue:work`). It sits *above* the
   events purely to avoid duplicating the loop.
2. **"Send immediately" auto-dispatches on Create.** `store()` with `schedule_type = immediate` (or
   absent) creates the setup + rows, then dispatches inline and sets `status='started'`,
   `send_status='sent'`, `last_dispatched_at` — no second "Send" click. This is why the picker's
   primary CTA both creates AND sends.
3. **Scheduling state machine is a SEPARATE column** (`send_status`: draft | scheduled | processing |
   sent | cancelled | failed) kept apart from the legacy operation `status`. New columns are additive
   forward-only (migration `2026_07_25_000002_add_scheduling_to_automation_setups.php`): `schedule_type`,
   `scheduled_at`, `send_status`, `last_dispatched_at` + a `(send_status, scheduled_at)` index. **DB is
   source of truth** (not a delayed queue job) — that is what makes Cancel + a status column clean and
   recoverable.
4. **A cron-driven command fires due rows.** `automations:dispatch-scheduled` (scheduled `->everyMinute()
   ->withoutOverlapping()` in `App\Console\Kernel`) claims each due row atomically
   (`scheduled → processing`, guarded update, skip if not claimed), dispatches via the service, then sets
   `status='started'`, `send_status='sent'`, `last_dispatched_at`; on throw → `send_status='failed'` +
   `Log::error`.
5. **Cancel** = `POST /admin/automations-setups/{id}/cancel` (gated `admin.can:automation,update`), allowed
   **only** while `send_status='scheduled'` → `cancelled`. The listing shows a Cancel action for exactly
   those rows and a `send_status` badge column (+ the scheduled time).
6. **Timezone:** `scheduled_at` is a naive **Asia/Riyadh** datetime (app timezone) compared to
   `Carbon::now()` in the same zone — no conversion. The masked date input's `minDate` blocks past
   days; the backend re-validates `after:now`.

**⚠️ Deploy requirement (NEW dependency):** scheduled automations only fire if the **Laravel scheduler**
runs in prod — either a cron `* * * * * php artisan schedule:run`, or a supervisor program running
`php artisan schedule:work`. This is **separate** from the existing `queue:work` supervisor (which is
reused unchanged for the actual sending). Without the scheduler, *immediate* automations still work
(dispatched inline on create), but *scheduled* ones sit in `send_status='scheduled'` forever. Also run
`php artisan migrate` (the `2026_07_25_000002_*` migration) on deploy.

**Files:** backend — `AutomationDispatchService` (new), `Console/Commands/DispatchScheduledAutomations`
(new), `Console/Kernel` (schedule), `AutomationController@send` (now calls the service),
`AutomationSetupsController@store` (schedule fields + auto-dispatch) + `cancel()`, `AutomationSetup`
(fillable/casts), `AutomationSetupsResources` (4 fields), `routes/api.php` (cancel route), migration
`2026_07_25_000002_*`; admin — `automation-settings-fields.tsx` (Scheduling section + type/defaults),
`automation-run-modal.tsx` (payload), `automation-listing.tsx` (send_status badge + Cancel),
`interfaces/automation-setup.tsx`, EN + AR `web.json`.

**Gates:** backend `pint --test` **passed** + `phpstan` **No errors** + `php artisan test` **469 passed**;
admin `yarn type-check` **green** + `eslint` clean on the changed files. `yarn production` not run (no
local `.env.production`; env files are gitignored). EN + AR keys in place.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** backend `38729eb` (P24.25 — service / command / Kernel / controllers / model /
resource / route / migration); admin `673f00d` (P24.25 — schedule step + send_status badge + Cancel + the
shared web.json keys, EN+AR). Docs on `main` carry this entry + HANDOFF.

**Still pending before it works end-to-end:** the migration is **applied on the dev DB** (all 4 columns
present); still needed — the **scheduler** running for scheduled sends (see the Deploy requirement above),
`php artisan migrate` on **prod** at deploy, and **manual testing** (automated gates pass, but the flow
hasn't been exercised against a real DB yet).

> **Addendum 2026-07-27 — the Deploy requirement above now has a concrete runbook.**
> [`process/QUEUE_SETUP_PROD.md`](../process/QUEUE_SETUP_PROD.md) (+ a PDF twin for DevOps) carries the

> from the 123 clone and de-branded. The decision itself is unchanged — this only means nobody has to

> **Addendum 2026-07-28 — a third scheduling option: `manual`.** Beside *immediate* and *scheduled*, an
> automation can now be saved as a **draft to run later by hand** (`schedule_type = 'manual'`,
> `send_status = 'draft'`, no dispatch on create); an admin runs it from the listing's Run action, which
> goes through the **existing** manual send endpoint `POST /automations/send/{id}` — no new endpoint, no
> new state machine. **No migration was needed:** `schedule_type` is `string(20)` in
> `2026_07_25_000002`, not an enum, so it accepts the third value as-is (don't "fix" this with a
> redundant migration). The listing's Run action is gated on `send_status === 'draft'`.
> **Parked item #2 above is still open and now has a second home:** the *details* page's Run button is
> still not gated on `send_status`, so it can dispatch a scheduled automation early. Backend `6e7fd94`,

## D40 — 2026-07-25 — Automation details page rebuilt on the shared listing primitives (D38 pattern), Clicked column hidden, shared `sent_at` label tidied

The per-guest automation details page (`/automation/details/[id]`) was still the old NextCrazy-generated
pattern (raw `<table>` + `TableCaption`/`TablePagination` + a bespoke `automation-details-search` + manual
fetch). Rebuilt on the **same shared primitives** as the D38 listing — `useListingState` +
`ListingTable` / `ListingFilters` / `ListingFooter` + `TopSection` — so it matches the admin theme.

**Durable points:**

1. **Setup-level fields live once, not per row.** `name` + `email_template` are constant across every row
   of a setup, so they moved out of the table into a small **summary card** (name · template · total
   guests). The table is now purely per-guest: Guest (name + email) · Category · Sent (badge) · Sent at ·
   Delivered · Opened.
2. **Behaviour preserved:** the **MORE** menu (Split by 500 / Send To All), **Export**, the is_sent status
   filter (all / yes / null), and the back button all carry over unchanged. Pagination now routes through
   `useListingState`, which also **fixes the old broken `automations/details/` paginate path**.
3. **`Clicked` column hidden** for now (kept in the interface + backend + resource; a one-line comment in
   `automation-details.tsx` shows how to restore it). Delivered / Opened / Clicked are webhook-populated
   tracking flags that are usually empty.
4. **Shared `web:sent_at` EN label tidied** from the literal `"sent_at"` → `"Sent at"` (AR was already
   proper). That key is shared, so the logs / e-visa headers get the nicer label too — an intentional,
   net-positive side effect.
5. **Orphaned `automation-details-search.tsx` deleted** (only this page used it).

**Open edge (parked):** the details page still exposes the manual "Send To All" action, which would
dispatch a *scheduled* automation **early** if clicked before its time — it is not gated on
`send_status = scheduled`. Left as-is (a manual override is defensible); gate it later if unwanted.

**Also parked (raised, user chose to hold):** the listing now shows **two** near-redundant status columns —
legacy **Operation status** (`status`: not_started / started / splitted) and the new **Send status**
(`send_status`). They move in lockstep for immediate automations and only diverge for scheduled ones;
collapsing to a single column is a pending UI decision.

**Files:** admin — `automation/automation-details.tsx` (rewrite), `pages/[lang]/automation/details/[id].tsx`
(simplified to `mode` only), deleted `shared/forms/filters/automation-details-search.tsx`, `translations/{en,ar}/web.json`
(`opened`, `no_email`, `sent_at` tidy).

**Gates:** admin `yarn type-check` + `eslint` clean. (`yarn production` not run — no local `.env.production`.)

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** admin `903013c` (P24.26).

## D41 — 2026-07-25 — WhatsApp RBAC rules added to `inferFeatureId` (completes D33 coverage; the D34 `check:rbac` guard is now in the documented gate)

The WhatsApp channel (D36) shipped its routes + sidebar features (`whatsapp_logs`, `whatsapp_templates`,
`whatsapp_config`) but **never added the matching `inferFeatureId` rules** — so it hit the exact D33
first-match-wins trap that D33/P18.2 fixed for SMS. `check:rbac` failed with **4 errors**:
`/logs/(guest|invitation)-whatsapp` fell through to the generic `/logs` rule → `email_logs`, and
`/whatsapp/templates` + `/whatsapp/provider-configs` matched nothing → `null` (Super-Admin only).

**User impact (same as the P18.2 SMS bug):** an admin granted `whatsapp_logs` saw the link and got "not
authorized"; one granted only `email_logs` rendered the WhatsApp log page and then ate a 403; and the two
config features were effectively **ungrantable**.

**Fix (3 rules mirroring SMS, `utils/inferFeatureId.ts`):** `/logs/(guest|invitation)-whatsapp` →
`whatsapp_logs` **placed before** the generic `/logs` rule; `/whatsapp/templates` → `whatsapp_templates`
**before** the generic `/whatsapp` → `whatsapp_config`. `check:rbac` now green (0 errors, 46 → 49 rules).

**Process note (why it slipped):** `yarn check:rbac` (the D34 guard) is a **standalone script** — NOT run
by `composer qa`, `yarn type-check`, or `yarn production` — so a gate run that skips it misses this bug
class. It is now written into the documented gate: `ai/CURRENT_WORKFLOW.md` + `process/SETUP_AND_UPDATE.md`
(and the old "check:rbac not in the gate" note in `tasks/PHASE22_PARKED_TODO.md` is marked resolved). Run
it on any change touching routes / the sidebar / `inferFeatureId.ts`.

**Baseline fix:** applied here in `alt-static-basecode` (the baseline) so clones (e.g. `123-pif-pep-v2`)
catch up via `--ff-only` rather than each patching locally.

**Landed (pushed, on `dev`):** admin `fe1ac09` (P24.27).

## D42 — 2026-07-25 — Seating Plan Manager ported into the baseline as a 4th sub-app (`alt-static-basecode-seating`), API-wire, RBAC-graded

**What:** brought the standalone **Seating Plan Manager** — a Vite/React SPA the client demoed for a month in
v1 (`120-pif-private-events-platform`) — into the 121 baseline as a **new 4th sub-app**, so every clone
(immediate consumer `123-pif-pep-v2`) inherits it. It integrates **API-wire** (no UI merge): signs in as an
admin, polls guests, writes seat + attendance back onto the guests table, stores the board in `seating_layouts`.

**Decisions (promoted from `tasks/021-seating/TASK.md` D-1…D-8):**
- **D-1/D-2:** build in the **baseline** (not the clone); a standalone sub-app — retarget its API client, don't
  rebuild in Next (proven, decoupled, canvas-heavy; SSR buys nothing).
- **D-3 attendance:** 6 new shared columns (`checked_in_at/by`, `checked_out_at/by`, `food_checked_in_at/by`);
  a `Guest::booted()` bridge keeps the legacy `check_in` boolean in sync. "One-truth" cleanup deferred.
- **D-4 handoff:** the SPA uses its **own login** (no token handoff — the admin bearer is HttpOnly, D12); the
  admin side is a gated deep-link. One-click SSO (a minted scoped token) is a possible follow-up.
- **D-5 RBAC:** a dedicated **`seating`** feature with graded actions **`view`/`check_in`/`manage`**, mapped to
  the SPA's existing 11-permission tiers via its one `mapAdminToUser` function. Enforced **both** server
  (`admin.can:seating,<action>`) and client — v1 enforced tiers client-side only. Never `admins.type`.
- **D-6:** full port incl. `seating_layout_versions` + `seating_audit_logs`.
- **D-7:** keep the Vite/JS/Tailwind-v3 SPA as-is (own build chain). **D-8:** repo `alt-static-basecode-seating`.

**Migrations:** additive, forward-only at `2026_07_25_000005..000008` (000001–000004 were taken by automation +
task 020). Seat/attendance **writes ride** `PUT /admin/guests/{id}` (`guests_listing,edit`) — so a write-capable
seating operator also needs that grant; a dedicated seating-scoped write endpoint is a possible follow-up.

**Mobile contract:** new routes are **admin-only** (`/admin/seating-layout*`, `/admin/seating-audit-log`,
`/admin/me`) + 6 additive `GuestsResources` fields → additive only, nothing removed/renamed.

**Gates:** backend `pint --test` clean + `phpstan` No-errors + `php artisan test` **480 pass** (6 new); admin
`type-check` clean + `check:rbac` OK; seating `npm run build` clean.

**Status — MERGED + PUSHED (2026-07-26).** Backend + admin `feat/seating` merged to `dev` (`076cb8d` / `0f34b2d`);
docs on `main`. **SPA re-based (addendum):** the initial fork was stale (`d145e13`); it was rebuilt on the current
120 upstream **`85fecfb`** — the version the client actually tested (dark-mode theming, room presets, table-shape
geometry, a SyncStatus indicator; 3 backend-less modals dropped) — keeping the **full 120 git history** so future
upstream updates can be pulled, with the retarget re-applied (`guests/{id}` + `permissions.seating`). Published to
`eissa-alt/alt-static-basecode-seating` (`dev`+`main` `09d23a5`), `npm run build` clean; 123 `pif-pep-v2-seating`
re-cloned to match. **Backend + admin needed NO change** — the `85fecfb` API contract equals what was built (the
D-6 full port already covered the `seating-audit-log` endpoints the newer SPA calls). **Pending owner:** set `.env`
(`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEATING_MANAGER_URL`, seating `VITE_*`); `php artisan migrate`; live QA.

> **Addendum 2026-07-28 — the admin launch button described above no longer renders.** The
> `seating`-gated "Seating Manager" deep-link was removed from the guests-listing toolbar (admin
> `5b19580`, `P025.1`). **Everything behind it is intact** — the `seating` RBAC feature, the
> `alt-static-basecode-seating` sub-app, the backend `/admin/seating-*` endpoints, the
> `OpenSeatingManagerButton` component, its EN/AR labels, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEATING_MANAGER_URL` — so
> re-adding the button is a one-line change and the SPA is still reachable by its own URL under its own
> login. Read this decision as "seating is integrated, but not advertised from the admin."

## D43 — 2026-07-27 — Guest history records WHAT an edit changed — as a redacted delta, never a snapshot

**What:** `history_logs` rows gained `previous_payload` / `payload` (additive migration
`2026_07_27_000001`), filled in `GuestsController::updateGuest`, and the admin renders them as a
`Field | From | To` table in the guest see-more modal. Prompted by a comparison against
`115-cyan-basecode`, which had the richer version first (`2026_05_06_000004_extend_history_logs_for_payload`).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **A DELTA, never a snapshot — this is the load-bearing one.** Only fields that actually changed are
   stored. Cyan snapshots the whole record on both sides, but it can afford to: cyan's guests table has
   **no PII columns at all** (everything is one `form_data` JSON blob) and its uploads sit on the
   **public** disk. 121 is the opposite on both counts — ~110 fillable columns including `religion`,
   `birth_date`, `document_number`, `full_name_on_document`, plus five **private-disk** file fields that
   exist because of D14. A verbatim port would have made `history_logs` the largest uncontrolled PII
   store in the database, rewritten on every edit, with **no erasure path** (`guest_id` has no
   `onDelete`). It is also a volume problem independent of privacy: the **Seating Plan Manager writes
   every seat drag through `PUT /admin/guests/{id}`**, the same handler that logs — a full snapshot
   would persist a passport number twice for a seat move. **Do not "complete" this feature by adding
   snapshots.**
2. **File fields record only THAT they changed** (`[file]` sentinel), never the value. `personal_image`,
   `document_copy`, `visa_copy`, `issued_visa` are private-disk paths served exclusively through signed
   URLs (D14); writing the path into a plain json column routes around that control.
3. **`[]` and `null` mean different things, and the distinction survives to the client.** `[]` = the save
   ran and changed nothing → the UI says "No changes in edit". `null` = unknown — a row written before
   this feature, or an action that never carried a field edit → the UI keeps the plain one-line format.
   There is **no backfill** (the old values were never recorded), so the list stays permanently mixed.
4. **Cyan's `source` / `actor_type` / `ip` / `user_agent` were deliberately NOT ported.** `source`
   collides with the existing `guests.source` column; `actor_type` invites confusion with the retired
   `admins.type`; and cyan never renders `ip` nor even exposes `user_agent` — speculative storage.
   Capturing registrant IP on the public `/complete-data` / `/reconfirm` routes is a privacy-notice
   decision, not a code one.
5. **The dynamic-forms coupling is real but shallow, and it is in the producer only.** Cyan's admin diff
   renderer walks a `Record<string, unknown>` and prints raw keys — zero `FormDefinition` coupling, so it
   ports. Only `'payload' => $formDataNormalizer->normalize($form, …)` is coupled, and totally. So
   CLAUDE.md hard-rule 4 is **not** engaged by this port: the schema and the UI came across, the payload
   producer was re-authored against 121's static columns.
6. **Scope: one write site.** Only `updateGuest` carries a payload. The other 27 `HistoryLog::create`
   sites are state transitions (`Badge Printed`, `Hotel Assigned`, …) where the action name says
   everything.

**Not yet true:** this is **not** a complete audit trail. `importGuestsExcel`, the `upload*` methods,
`attend()` / `guestsSyncOffline()`, `reGenerateSMP()` and `MobileAuthController::updateProfile` (which
mutates guest phone and avatar) write **no history row at all**. Describe the feature accordingly, or
scope a follow-up.

**Also fixed en route:** the history view rendered an Email/First/Last table that looked like part of the
log but was read from react-hook-form — the guest's values *right now*, unrelated to any row. Deleted.
And the view now lives in the see-more modal: the `/extra/{id}` page it used to live on is reachable by
direct URL only, and resolves to feature-level `guests_listing` while the API requires
`guests_listing,see_more` — so the modal is both discoverable and the correct RBAC host.

**Landed (on `dev`, not pushed):** backend `0df228e` (P022.1); admin `a959703` (P022.2) + `5ae2afb`
(P022.3). Gates: pint + phpstan clean, **484 tests** (4 new — `history_logs` had zero coverage before),
admin `type-check` + `eslint` + `check:rbac` green, EN/AR 1760/1760. Dev DB migrated; **prod
`php artisan migrate` still pending**. Task log: `tasks/022-guest-history-payload/TASK.md`.

## D44 — 2026-07-27 — Single-record guest reads are scoped to the admin's categories/statuses

**What:** `applyAdminGuestAccessFilter` had always scoped guest **list** queries, but the single-record
reads had no equivalent — `GET /admin/guests/{id}` and `GET /admin/history-logs/{id}` returned any guest
to any admin holding the UUID, ignoring the categories/statuses that admin is bound to. Both are gated
`guests_listing,see_more`, so the caller is an admin — but one reading a guest they cannot see in any
listing. Task 022 (D43) sharpened the stakes by putting a field-level edit diff behind the history
endpoint, but the leak is the guest record itself via `show()`; the diff is incremental exposure on a
hole that predated it.

**Durable decisions:**

1. New `App\Support\GuestAccessScope::denies()` is a **single-record twin** of the list filter and must
   mirror it exactly: super bypasses; an admin with **no** restrictions set sees nothing (the list
   filter answers that case with `0 = 1`, not "everything"); category and status bounds are ANDed; `null`
   is permitted in the status list for the admin UI's "No-Value" option. Shape follows
   `GatesController::deniesGateScope`. **If either side's rules change, change both.**
2. **Behaviour change:** a scoped admin who could previously open any guest by UUID now gets **403**. The
   listing never showed them those guests, so no legitimate flow should depend on it.
3. **Not covered, deliberately:** `GuestDraftsController::show` has the same shape and `guest_drafts`
   does carry `category_id`, but it is a separate RBAC feature and whether drafts should be
   category-scoped at all is undecided.

**Landed:** backend `ae1c210` (`P023.1`) — committed + **pushed** to `origin/dev`. Gates: pint + phpstan
clean, **489 tests** (5 new). Not mobile-facing. Task log: `tasks/023-guest-access-scope/TASK.md`.

## D45 — 2026-07-27 — Admins get a phone number, named `phone` to match guests

**What:** admins gained a phone number, captured on create/edit and shown in the listing. Additive,
forward-only migration `2026_07_27_000002` adds a nullable `phone` (`string(100)`) to `admins`; exposed
via `AdminsResources` (login + `/me`) and the flat `AuthController::profile()`.

**Durable decisions:**

1. **Column is `phone`, not `phone_number`** — guests use `phone` everywhere (DB, API, forms), so admins
   match it for consistency (owner's explicit call). A clone that renames this field must rename it on
   both entities together.
2. **DB column nullable; "required" enforced at the request/form layer.** Existing admins predate the
   field and `migrate:fresh` is banned (real data), so a NOT-NULL column is impossible. `store` validates
   `required`; `update` validates `sometimes|required`. Owner chose required on create **and** edit — so
   editing a pre-existing admin now forces entering a phone before it can be saved.
3. **Widget = `PhoneInputV2`** (the guest phone widget: country flags + libphonenumber E.164), not the
   plain `CustomInput` the other admin fields use — consistency + real validation.
4. **Deferred, not dropped:** a phone **search/filter** on the admins listing (needs a backend `index`
   filter) and an **admins export** (none exists today).

**Also (same admin commit, owner request):** the create form now defaults **status ON** and the **Data
scope** section **expanded** (edit mode unaffected — `reset()` loads the record). And a shared-component
fix: `PhoneInputV2`'s error text used `text-error`, which is **not a defined color** in the admin's
Tailwind v4 theme, so validation messages rendered gray — switched to `text-red-500`; this also corrects
the guest admin forms, which share the component.

**Landed:** backend `f1c3dc3` (`P024.1`), admin `f743fae` (`P024.2`) — committed + **pushed**. Gates:
pint + phpstan clean, 489 tests; admin `type-check` + eslint green; EN/AR reused (`web:phone`,
`validation:invalid_phone`, no new keys). Dev DB migrated; prod `migrate` + manual QA pending. Not
mobile-facing (`/admin/admins`, `routes/api.php` untouched). Task log: `tasks/024-admin-phone/TASK.md`.

## D46 — 2026-07-28 — Cloning a category deep-copies it: `replicate()` for columns, plus relations and its own poster files

**What:** `CategoriesController::clone` was producing a partial copy — the admin had to re-enter settings
by hand on every clone. Rewritten to copy everything a category owns, inside one `DB::transaction`.

**Durable decisions:**

1. **`replicate()`, never `getAttributes()` + `fill()`.** The old path ran the copied attributes through
   `fill()`, so **any column missing from `$fillable` was silently dropped** — and would keep being
   dropped for every column added in future. `replicate()` copies every column regardless of `$fillable`
   and resets id/timestamps. This is the part that must survive: a clone must not depend on `$fillable`
   being complete.
2. **Relations are copied explicitly, in the transaction:** badge assignments (`badge_category` pivot,
   via the Eloquent relation), admin data scope (`admins.category_ids` — a JSON column, not a pivot, so
   it reuses the existing `adminsWithCategory()` / `syncCategoryAdmins()` helpers), and meeting-room
   links (`meeting_room_categories` — no Eloquent relation on `Category`, so rows are inserted directly).
   **Adding a new category relation means adding it here too** — there is no generic mechanism.
3. **Share-poster files are duplicated, never shared.** `duplicatePoster()` copies each poster to a fresh
   random basename on the public disk, so editing or deleting one category's poster can never affect the
   other; `share_poster_url` is recomputed to match `CategoriesResources`. A missing source file returns
   the original name unchanged rather than failing the clone.
4. **Consequence to know before cloning:** copying the admin data scope means the clone is visible to
   every admin who could see the original — it inherits its source's visibility rather than starting
   private. That is the intended meaning of "a copy of this category", but it is a real access-surface
   change on a wide-scoped source.

**Unchanged:** the slug/name copy behaviour (`{slug}-copy`, `-copy-1`, …, and `(Copy)` / `(نسخة)`
appended to the names) and the `titles.cat_list` update.

**Landed:** backend `0be944e` (`P027.1`), +94/−41 — committed + **pushed**. Gates: pint clean at commit
time via the pre-commit hook; **`composer qa` has not been re-run since**. **No automated test covers
`clone`** — add one alongside the browser QA. Not mobile-facing (`/admin/categories`, `routes/api.php`
untouched). Task log: [`tasks/027-category-clone-fix/TASK.md`](../tasks/027-category-clone-fix/TASK.md).

## D47 — 2026-07-28 — Guest-listing row actions are gated per category, defaulting OFF

**What:** each category now decides which of the five guest-listing row actions its guests expose —
resend email / SMS / WhatsApp, print badge, mark collected — and the issued-visa email template sits
behind its own `with_issued_visa` toggle instead of being inferred from "a template is selected". Two
additive, forward-only migrations: `2026_07_28_000001` (the five row-action booleans) and
`2026_07_28_000002` (`with_issued_visa`).

**Durable decisions:**

1. **The category switch is an ADDITIONAL gate on top of RBAC, not a replacement.** An action renders
   only when the category switch **and** `checkActionPermission(...)` both pass. Neither one alone.
2. **⚠️ The five row-action toggles default to `false` and are NOT backfilled.** Existing categories opt
   in explicitly. **Operational consequence: the moment this migration runs, every guest row action
   disappears from every category until an admin turns it back on — including *print badge*.** Turn the
   switches on per category immediately after the prod migrate, before any on-site use. The dev DB is
   already migrated; **prod is not.**
3. **`with_issued_visa` IS backfilled** (`update … where issued_visa_email is not null`). The asymmetry
   with #2 is deliberate: the old issued-visa behaviour was itself derived from a selected template, so a
   backfill reproduces it exactly; the row actions had no equivalent signal to derive from.
4. **A switched-on comms action stays visible but disabled when its provider isn't configured**, with a
   `web:provider_not_configured` tooltip — so an admin can tell "not allowed for this category" from
   "not set up yet". Readiness comes from the three existing `*/check-default` endpoints, mirroring the
   categories and automation forms.
5. **The listing reads the switches off the guest row's embedded category** (`row.category?.with_*`).
   `GuestsResources` serialises the whole `category` model, so the new columns ride along with no
   resource change — but that also means **the gating depends on `category` staying eagerly loaded** on
   the guests index. Dropping that eager load would hide every row action.

**Landed:** backend `072dff2` + admin `718bcf7` (both `P028.1`) — committed + **pushed**. EN + AR in the
same commit (11 keys each). Gates: pre-commit hooks green at commit time; **full gate not re-run since**.
Dev DB migrated; **prod `migrate` + per-category switch-on + manual QA pending.** Not mobile-facing
(`/admin/*`, `routes/api.php` untouched). Task log:
[`tasks/028-category-guest-action-gates/TASK.md`](../tasks/028-category-guest-action-gates/TASK.md).
